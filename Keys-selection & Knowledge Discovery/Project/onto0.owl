It has, according to the authorities of the country in 2006, 5,068,858 residents in the metropolitan area and 3,796,677 residents in the municipality. Only Lagos, the former capital of Nigeria has a larger number of inhabitants in this region. Considered a cultural hub of West Africa or Africa, Abidjan in the 21st century is characterized by high industrialization and urbanization. The city stands in &amp;#201;bri&amp;#233; Lagoon on several converging peninsulas and islands, connected by bridges.
The city grew after the construction of a new wharf in 1931 and its designation as the capital of the then French colony in 1933. The completion of the Vridi Canal in 1951 enabled it to become an important sea port. In 1983, Yamoussoukro was designated as the nation&#39;s capital, but most government offices and foreign embassies are still in Abidjan.

Abuja as well as being one of the wealthiest and most expensive; however, the population on the semi-developed edges of the city live in shanty towns such as Karu. Karu, originally planned to house the capital&#39;s civil servants and lower income families, still has an unstable electricity supply.
In light of the ethnic and religious divisions of Nigeria, plans had been devised since Nigeria&#39;s independence to have its capital in a location deemed neutral to all parties. The location was eventually designated in the centre of the&lt;/p&gt;

Named in honour of Queen Adelaide, the German-born consort of King William IV, the city was founded in 1836 as the planned capital for a freely settled British province in Australia. Colonel William Light, one of Adelaide&#39;s founding fathers, designed the city and chose its location close to the River Torrens in the area originally inhabited by the Kaurna people. Light&#39;s design set out Adelaide in a grid layout, interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares, and entirely surrounded by parkland.

Garcia emigrated from Cuba as a young boy; certain family members stayed behind, including a sister who married a Cuban Army officer.

His superiors look on him fondly as &quot;an excellent detective with no ambition to be anything more.&quot;
In Tourist Season he investigates several suspicious deaths of tourists, but is initially censured when he suggests that an extremist group is targeting tourists. When the fact becomes impossible to ignore, he is put in charge of a special task force to catch the terrorists. One of the terrorists, Jesus Bernal, trying to raise his own prestige among anti-Castro Cubans in Florida, labels Garcia a &quot;traitor&quot; and kidnaps him at gunpoint.

At the 2000 census, the city had a total population of 72,259. Alameda is a charter city, rather than a general law city, meaning that the city can provide for any form of government. Alameda became a charter city and adopted a council-manager government in 1916, which it retains to the present.
The island that Alameda occupies was originally a peninsula connected to Oakland. Much of the peninsula was low-lying and marshy, but on higher ground the peninsula and adjacent parts of what is now downtown Oakland were home to one of the largest coastal oak forests in the world. The area was therefore called Encinal, Spanish for &quot;oak grove&quot;. Alameda is Spanish for &quot;grove of poplar trees&quot; or &quot;tree-lined avenue&quot;, and was chosen in 1853 by popular vote.

Pakula started his Hollywood career as an assistant in the cartoon department at Warner Brothers. In 1957, he undertook his first production role for Paramount Pictures. In 1962, he produced To Kill a Mockingbird, for which he was nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award. In 1969, he directed his first feature, The Sterile Cuckoo, starring Liza Minnelli.
In 1971, Pakula released the first installment of what would informally come to be known as his &quot;paranoia trilogy&quot;. Klute, the story of a private eye&#39;s relationship with a call girl (played by Jane Fonda, who won an Oscar for her performance), was a commercial and critical success. This was followed in 1974 by The Parallax View starring Warren Beatty, a labyrinthine post-Watergate thriller involving political assassinations. The film has been noted for its experimental use of hypnotic imagery in a celebrated film-within-a-film sequence in which the protagonist is inducted into the Parallax Corporation, whose main, albeit non-ostensible, enterprise is domestic&lt;/p&gt;

Ladd was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas to an American father (Alan Ladd, Sr.) and an English-American mother (Ina Raleigh Ladd). His father died when he was four, and his mother relocated to Oklahoma City where she married Jim Beavers, a housepainter. The family then moved again to North Hollywood, California where Ladd became a high-school swimming and diving champion and participated in high school dramatics. He opened his own hamburger and malt shop, which he called Tiny&#39;s Patio. He worked briefly as a studio carpenter (as did his stepfather) and for a short time was part of the Universal Pictures studio school for actors. But Universal decided he was too blond and too short and dropped him. Intent on acting, he found work in radio.
Ladd began by appearing in dozens of films in small roles, including Citizen Kane in which he played one of the &quot;faceless&quot; reporters who are always shown in silhouette. He first gained some recognition with a featured role in the wartime thriller Joan of Paris, 1942. For his next role, his manager, Sue Carol, found a vehicle which made Ladd&#39;s career, Graham&lt;/p&gt;

He later won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Colonel Nicholson in The Bridge on the River Kwai. His most prominent role in his later career was as Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original Star Wars trilogy.
Guinness was born at 155 Lauderdale Mansions South, Lauderdale Road, Maida Vale, London as Alec Guinness De Cuffe. His mother&#39;s maiden name was Agnes Cuff. She was born 8 December 1890 to Edward Cuff and Mary Ann Cuff Benfield. On Guinness&#39;s birth certificate, the field for mother&#39;s name displays Agnes de Cuffe. In the field for the infant&#39;s name (where first names only are usually given), it says Alec Guinness. There is nothing written in the column for name and surname of father. On this basis it has been frequently speculated that the actor&#39;s father was a member of the Irish Guinness family.

Cox has previously cited Luis Bu&amp;#241;uel and Akira Kurosawa as influences, as well as the great Western movie directors Sergio Leone, Sam Peckinpah, and John Ford. Cox also wrote a book on the history of the genre called 10,000 Ways to Die. While he once directed films for Universal Pictures, such as Repo Man and Walker, since the late 1980s, he has found himself on a self-described blacklist, and turned to producing independent films. Cox is an atheist. He was originally set to direct Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas but was replaced by Terry Gilliam due to creative differences with Hunter S. Thompson. By August 2009, Cox had announced completion of Repo Chick, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival the following month, but he remained ambivalent as to whether the film would ever be distributed to theaters. His previous film, Searchers 2.0, was not released theatrically, and only appears on DVD in Japan.
Cox began a law degree at Oxford University, but left to pursue a film career.&lt;/p&gt;

Like the rest of northern Virginia, as well as central Maryland, modern Alexandria has been shaped by its proximity to the nation&#39;s capital. It is largely populated by professionals working in the federal civil service, the U.S. military, or for one of the many private companies which contract to provide services to the federal government. The latter are known locally as beltway bandits, after the Capital Beltway, an interstate highway that circles Washington, D.C. One of Alexandria&#39;s largest employers is the U.S. Department of Defense. Others include the Institute for Defense Analyses and the Center for Naval Analyses. In 2005, the United States Patent and Trademark Office moved 7,100 employees from 18 separate buildings in nearby Crystal City into a new headquarters complex in the city.

Hitchcock directed more than fifty feature films in a career spanning six decades. Often regarded as the greatest British filmmaker, he came first in a 2007 poll of film critics in Britain&#39;s Daily Telegraph newspaper, which said: &quot;Unquestionably the greatest filmmaker to emerge from these islands, Hitchcock did more than any director to shape modern cinema, which would be utterly different without him. His flair was for narrative, cruelly withholding crucial information (from his characters and from us) and engaging the emotions of the audience like no one else.&quot; MovieMaker has hailed him as the most influential filmmaker of all time.
Hitchcock was born on 13 August 1899 in Leytonstone, London, the second son and youngest of three children of William Hitchcock (1862&amp;#8211;1914), a greengrocer and&lt;/p&gt;

The city of Amsterdam is surrounded on the north, east, and west sides by the town of Amsterdam and is on the banks of the Mohawk River. The majority of the city lies on the north bank, but the Port Jackson area on the south side is also part of the city.
The city is within the original, now defunct town of Caughnawaga (meaning &quot;at the rapids&quot;), formed in northern Montgomery County in 1788.
It was first settled about 1710 by the Dutch. The community was called Veeders Mills and Veedersburgh after Albert Veeder, an early mill owner, but was changed to Amsterdam in 1803. In 1773, Guy Johnson built Guy Park, a stone Georgian mansion, but as a Loyalist, he fled to Canada during the Revolution.
A community in the town of Amsterdam incorporated as a village on April 20, 1830 from a section of the town of Amsterdam. New charters in 1854, 1865, and 1875 increased the size of the village.

Tarkovsky&#39;s films include Andrei Rublev, Solaris, The Mirror, and Stalker. He directed the first five of his seven feature films in the Soviet Union; his last two films were produced in Italy and Sweden, respectively. They are characterized by spirituality and metaphysical themes, extremely long takes, lack of conventional dramatic structure and plot, and memorable cinematography.
Ingmar Bergman said of him: &quot;Tarkovsky for me is the greatest [director], the one who invented a new language, true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream&quot;.
Tarkovsky was born in the village of Zavrazhye in Ivanovo Oblast, the son of poet and translator Arseny Alexandrovich Tarkovsky, native of Kirovohrad, Ukraine, and Maria Ivanova Vishnyakova, a graduate of the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute.
Tarkovsky spent his childhood in Yuryevets. He was described by childhood friends as active and popular, having many friends and being typically in the center of action. In 1937, his&lt;/p&gt;

Griffith was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by U.S. President George W. Bush on November 9, 2005.
Griffith was born in Mount Airy, North Carolina, the only child of Geneva (n&amp;#233;e Nunn) and Carl Lee Griffith. At a very young age, Griffith had to live with relatives until his parents could afford to get a home of their own. Without a crib or a bed, he slept in drawers for a few months. In 1929, when Griffith was three years old, his father took a job working as a carpenter and was finally able to purchase a home in Mount Airy&#39;s &quot;blue-collar&quot; southside.
Like his mother, Griffith grew up listening to music. His father instilled a sense of humor from old family stories. By the time he entered school he was well aware that he was from what many considered the&lt;/p&gt;

It consists of the main island of Anguilla itself, approximately 26&amp;#160;km (16&amp;#160;mi) long by 5&amp;#160;km (3.1&amp;#160;mi) wide at its widest point, together with a number of much smaller islands and cays with no permanent population. The island&#39;s capital is The Valley. The total land area of the territory is 91&amp;#160;km (35&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi), with a population of approximately 13,500 (2006 estimate).
Anguilla was first settled by Amerindian tribes who migrated from South America. The earliest Amerindian artifacts found on Anguilla have been dated to around 1300 BC, and remains of settlements date from 600 AD. The date of European discovery is uncertain: some sources claim that Columbus sighted the island in 1493, while others state that the island was first discovered by the French in 1564 or 1565. The name Anguilla derives from the word for &quot;eel&quot; in any of various Romance languages (modern Spanish: anguila; French: anguille; Italian: anguilla), probably chosen because of the island&#39;s eel-like shape.
Anguilla was first colonised by English settlers from&lt;/p&gt;

Located in eastern China across the basins of the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River, it borders Jiangsu to the east, Zhejiang to the southeast, Jiangxi to the south, Hubei to the southwest, Henan to the northwest, and Shandong for a tiny section in the north.

The name &quot;Anhui&quot; derives from the names of two cities in south Anhui, Anqing and Huizhou (now Huangshan City). The abbreviation for Anhui is &quot;W&amp;#462;n&quot;, because there were historically a State of Wan, a Mount Wan, and a Wan river in the province.
The province of Anhui was formed in the seventeenth century. Before then, there was no coherent concept of &quot;Anhui&quot;. Northern Anhui was firmly a part of the North China Plain in terms of culture, together with modern-day Henan province. Central Anhui constituted most of the fertile and densely-populated Huai He River watershed. Southern Anhui, along the Yangtze, was closer to Hubei and southern Jiangsu provinces in culture.

Hall began his career in commercials and on stage as a child, and made his screen debut in 1980. His films with director-screenwriter John Hughes, beginning with the popular 1984 coming-of-age comedy Sixteen Candles, shaped his early career. Hall&#39;s next movies with Hughes were the teen classics The Breakfast Club and Weird Science, both in 1985. His performances as lovable geeks in these three films connected his name and face with the stereotype for an entire generation.
Hall diversified his roles to avoid becoming typecast as his geek persona, joining the cast of Saturday Night Live (1985&amp;#8211;1986) and starring in films such as Out Of Bounds (1986), Johnny Be Good (1988), Edward Scissorhands (1990) and Six Degrees of Separation (1993). After a series of minor roles in the 1990s, his performance as Microsoft&#39;s Bill Gates in the 1999 film Pirates of Silicon Valley put him back in the spotlight.

Antibes was founded as a 5th century BCE Greek colony settled by Phocaeans from Massilia. Due to its naturally protected port, the town of Antibes has long been an important trading centre. Many different people ruled over Antibes until France finally took control.
As the Greek Empire fell into decline, it began incorporating the small towns into its empire. In 43 BC, Antibes (or Antipolis, as it was then called) was officially annexed by Rome and remained so for the next 500 years. The Romans turned Antipolis into the biggest town in the region and a main entry point into Gaul. Roman artefacts such as aqueducts, fortified walls and amphora can still be seen today.
When the Roman Empire fell apart in 476, various barbarian tribes took their turn at Antibes. The main result was destruction and a long period of instability. In the 10th&lt;/p&gt;

Its prehistoric peoples had no written language; analyses of archaeological excavations were used to develop current knowledge of their existence.
Antigua was first settled by Archaic Age hunter-gatherer Amerindians, erroneously referred to as Siboney or Cibony. Carbon-dating has established that the earliest settlements started around 3100 BCE. They were succeeded by the Ceramic Age pre-Columbian Arawak-speaking Saladoid people who migrated from the lower Orinoco River.

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic (Spanish: Rep&amp;#250;blica Argentina, pronounced&amp;#160;[re&amp;#712;pu&amp;#946;lika arxen&amp;#712;tina]), is the second largest country in South America, constituted as a federation of 23 provinces and an autonomous city, Buenos Aires. It is the eighth-largest country in the world by land area and the largest among Spanish-speaking nations, though Mexico, Colombia and Spain are more populous.
Argentina&#39;s continental area is between the Andes mountain range in the west and the Atlantic Ocean in the east. It borders Paraguay and Bolivia to the north, Brazil and Uruguay to the northeast, and Chile to the west and south. Argentine claims over Antarctica, overlapping claims made by Chile and the United Kingdom, are suspended by the Antarctic Treaty of 1961. Argentina also claims the Falkland Islands (Spanish: Islas Malvinas) and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, which are administered by the United Kingdom as British Overseas Territories.
Argentina is a founding member of both the United Nations and the Union of South American Nations. Argentina is one of the G-20 major economies.
The name is derived from the Latin argentum (silver), which comes from the Ancient Greek&lt;/p&gt;

Assante was born in New York City and raised in Cornwall, New York, the son of Katherine, a music teacher and poet, and Armand Anthony Assante, Sr., a painter and artist. His father was Italian American and his mother was Irish American, and he was raised in a devoutly Roman Catholic family.
During the 1970s, Assante was a regular on two NBC soap operas, How to Survive a Marriage as Johnny McGee and The Doctors as Dr. Mike Powers. His first film was The Lords of Flatbush (1974). A role that brought him greater attention came in 1980&#39;s Private Benjamin as a handsome Frenchman who becomes the love interest of a U.S. soldier played by Goldie Hawn.
Assante&#39;s somewhat sinister look has made him a popular choice for tough-guy heroes, as in his starring role as private eye Mike Hammer in the film I, the Jury (1982) or as Mafia gangsters like that of Michael Moretti in Sidney Sheldon&#39;s Rage of Angels. He portrayed the notorious Bugsy Siegel in a comedy, Neil Simon&#39;s The Marrying Man (1991), another mobster in Hoffa (1992) starring Jack Nicholson, and crime kingpin John Gotti in the 1996 made-for-television biopic&lt;/p&gt;

Astoria Heights, more commonly referred to as &quot;Upper Ditmars.&quot; Ranked #1 on the 2009 Forbes.com Top 10 overall &quot;Secure and Amiable Neighborhoods&quot; review, Astoria was rated the safest neighborhood in New York State, ahead of East Amherst and Chester, New York.
The area now known as Astoria was originally called Hallet&#39;s Cove, after its first landowner William Hallet, who settled there in 1659 with his wife Elizabeth Fones. It was renamed after John Jacob Astor, the wealthiest man in America, with a net worth of over $40 million, in order to persuade him to invest $2,000 in the neighborhood. He only invested $500, but the name stayed nonetheless, as a bitter battle over naming the village was finally won by Astor&#39;s supporters and friends.

For at least 40,000 years before European settlement in the late 18th century, the Australian mainland and Tasmania were inhabited by around 250 language groups of indigenous Australians. After sporadic visits by fishermen from the immediate north, and discovery by Dutch explorers in 1606, the eastern half of Australia was claimed by the British in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales, founded on 26 January 1788. The population grew steadily in the following years; the continent was explored, and another five largely self-governing Crown Colonies were established during the 19th century.

The need for a National Territory was flagged by colonial delegates during the Federation conventions of the late 19th century. Section 125 of the Australian Constitution provided that following Federation in 1901, land would be ceded freely to the new Federal Government. The territory was transferred to the Commonwealth by the state of New South Wales in 1911, two years prior to the naming of Canberra as the National Capital in 1913.
The floral emblem of the ACT is the Royal Bluebell and the faunal emblem is the Gang-gang Cockatoo.
The ACT is bounded by the Goulburn-Cooma railway line in the east, the watershed of Naas Creek in the south, the watershed of the Cotter River in the west, and the watershed of the Molonglo River in the north-east.

It borders Germany and the Czech Republic to the north, Slovakia and Hungary to the east, Slovenia and Italy to the south, and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west. The territory of Austria covers 83,872&amp;#160;square kilometres (32,383&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi), and has a temperate and alpine climate. Austria&#39;s terrain is highly mountainous due to the presence of the Alps; only 32% of the country is below 500&amp;#160;metres (1,640&amp;#160;ft), and its highest point is 3,797&amp;#160;metres (12,457&amp;#160;ft). The majority of the population speaks German, which is also the country&#39;s official language. Other local official languages are Croatian, Hungarian and Slovene.
The origins of Austria date back to the time of the Roman Empire when a Celtic kingdom was conquered by the Romans in approximately 15 BC, and later became Noricum, a Roman province, in the mid 1st century AD&amp;#8212;an area which mostly encloses today&#39;s Austria. In 788 AD, the Frankish king Charlemagne conquered the area, and introduced&lt;/p&gt;

The city was founded in 1889 in what was then the French colony Haut-Oubangui (&#39;Upper Ubangi&#39;), later renamed Oubangui-Chari and made part of French Equatorial Africa. Named for local rapids, the city grew around the French military post on the Ubangi river. Bangui served as an administration center in the colonial era and continues to be the administrative center of the CAR.
Widespread violence in Bangui followed the March 1981 elections, which took place following a French operation to depose Jean-Bedel Bokassa in 1979 and replace him with David Dacko. Opponents of unpopular Dacko laid siege to Bangui and compelled his flight to exile.

Bayside&#39;s history dates back to 2000 B.C., when the Matinecock Native American tribe first settled there. In the late 17th century, the area was settled by English colonists. By the middle of the 18th century, early settlers left their homes in Flushing and developed a farming community, Bay Side. During the Revolutionary War, the Bayside-Little Neck area suffered from raids by whaleboatmen from the Connecticut shores. In one of the raids, the Talman house was attacked and the miller was killed. In the 19th century Bayside was still mostly farmland. Middle 20th century urban sprawl, with the help of better roads, suburbanized it. During the 1920s, many actors and actresses, such as Rudolph Valentino, lived in Bayside. It was known as&lt;/p&gt;

The population was 12,496 at the 2000 census. It is the county seat of Gage County. The city&#39;s name is pronounced &quot;Bee-AT-russ&quot;. This pronunciation is credited to a brass-voiced railroad conductor.
Beatrice is located at 40&amp;#176;16&amp;#8242;6&amp;#8243;N 96&amp;#176;44&amp;#8242;35&amp;#8243;W&amp;#65279; / &amp;#65279;40.26833&amp;#176;N 96.74306&amp;#176;W&amp;#65279; / 40.26833; -96.74306 (40.268449, -96.743192).
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 7.5&amp;#160;square miles (19.4&amp;#160;km&amp;#178;), all of it land.
As of the census of 2000, there were 12,496 people, 5,395 households, and 3,301 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,666.7 people per square mile (643.3/km&amp;#178;). There were 5,818 housing units at an average density of 776.0/sq&amp;#160;mi (299.5/km&amp;#178;). The racial makeup of the city was&lt;/p&gt;

The city&#39;s population was 113,866 at the 2000 census. With Port Arthur and Orange, it forms the Golden Triangle, a major industrial area on the Gulf Coast.
Lamar University is based in Beaumont. The city&#39;s daily newspaper is The Beaumont Enterprise, while The Examiner is published weekly.
Gulf States Utilities had its headquarters in Beaumont until its absorption by Entergy Corporation in 1993. GSU&#39;s Edison Plaza headquarters is still the tallest building in Beaumont (as of 2007). Since 1907, Beaumont has been home of the South Texas State Fair. In 2004, the venue for the Fair changed to Ford Park, a new, larger facility on the west end of Beaumont.
The city of Beaumont was named by Henry Millard after his late wife Mary Dewburleigh Barlace Warren Beaumont. Millard came to Texas in 1835 and, along with his business partners, purchased some land between the settlements of Tevis Bluff and Santa Anna. On this property, they founded the city of Beaumont.
Beaumont became a town on December 16, 1838. Joseph Perkins Pulsifer was a founding citizen&lt;/p&gt;

It is located 8.4 miles (13.5&amp;#160;km) south east of Charing Cross, and 1.75 miles (2.8&amp;#160;km) west of Bromley town. Until the coming of the railway Beckenham was a small village in almost completely rural surroundings: once a family of entrepreneurs began the building of villas here, its population soared throughout the rest of the century. Today it is very much in London suburbia, although some of the grand houses of the early days remain.
The settlement is referred to as Bacheham in the Domesday Book of 1086. The name is thought to derive from Beohha&#39;s homestead (Beohhan + ham in Old English). The name of the small stream here - the River Beck - is most likely to have been named after the village.
Although early written history tells little of the area, archaeological evidence at Holwood Park, where Stone Age and Bronze Age artefacts were found, reveals some evidence of early settlers. A Roman camp was sited here; and a Roman road, the London to Lewes Way passed through the district.
With the arrival of the Normans, the Manor of Beckenham took on added importance, and controlled much of what is modern Beckenham. St George&amp;#8217;s&lt;/p&gt;

Established in 1730 as Narragansett Number 5 for the benefit of soldiers who fought against the Narragansett Indians in Rhode Island, it was regranted first as Souhegan East, then as Bedford in 1750. The town was named for Lord John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford, Secretary of State for the Southern Department (1748&amp;#8211;1751), and a close friend of Governor Benning Wentworth, whose first wife, Diana Spencer, was cousin to the Duke of Marlborough. The first settlers in Bedford were Robert and James Walker III. A monument dated 1737 stands on what is now known as Hawthorne Drive, marking the first settlement. Bedford&#39;s first moderator was Mayor John Goffe, son of Colonel John Goffe, for whom Goffstown was named.
Like much of southeastern New Hampshire, Bedford has grown rapidly over the last fifty years. The 2000 population of 18,274 was over eight times the population in 1950 of 2,176. Every decade has had a substantial rate of growth, ranging from 33 percent between 1980-1990 to a 67&lt;/p&gt;

Its capital is Minsk; other major cities include Brest, Grodno (Hrodna), Gomel (Homiel), Mogilev (Mahilyow) and Vitebsk (Viciebsk). Forty percent of its 207600&amp;#160;km is forested, and its strongest economic sectors are agriculture and manufacturing.
Until the 20th century, the Belarusians lacked the opportunity to create a distinctive national identity because for centuries the lands of modern-day Belarus belonged to several ethnically different countries, including the Principality of Polotsk, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Russian Empire, and the Polish&amp;#8211;Lithuanian Commonwealth. After the short-lived Belarusian People&amp;#8217;s Republic (1918&amp;#8211;19), Belarus became one of the founding constituent republic of the Soviet Union and was renamed into the Byelorussian SSR. The final unification of Belarusian lands took place in 1939 when lands occupied by the&lt;/p&gt;

It is a founding member of the European Union and hosts its headquarters, as well as those of other major international organizations, including NATO. Belgium covers an area of 30,528&amp;#160;square kilometres (11,787&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi), and it has a population of about 10.7&amp;#160;million people.
Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups, the Flemish and the French-speakers, mostly Walloons, plus a small group of German-speakers. Belgium&#39;s two largest regions are the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders in the north and the French-speaking southern region of Wallonia. The Brussels-Capital Region, officially bilingual, is a mostly French-speaking enclave within the Flemish Region. A small German-speaking Community exists in eastern Wallonia. Belgium&#39;s linguistic diversity and related political and cultural conflicts are reflected in the political history and a complex system of government.
The name &#39;Belgium&#39; is derived from Gallia Belgica, a Roman province in the northernmost part of Gaul that was inhabited by the Belgae,&lt;/p&gt;

Belgravia is to the south-west of Buckingham Palace. Belgravia is approximately bounded by Knightsbridge to the north (the street of that name, not the district), Grosvenor Place and Buckingham Palace Road to the east, Pimlico Road to the south, and Sloane Street to the west.
Most of the area was owned by Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster, who had it developed from the 1820s. Thomas Cubitt was the main contractor. Belgravia is characterised by grand terraces of white stucco houses, and is focused on the Belgrave Square and Eaton Square. It was one of London&#39;s most fashionable residential districts from the beginning, and remains so to this day. It is a relatively quiet district in the heart of London, contrasting with neighbouring districts which have far more busy shops, large modern office buildings, hotels, and entertainment venues. Many embassies are located in the area, especially in Belgrave Square.

Belize has a diverse society, comprising many cultures and speaking many languages. Although Kriol and Spanish are spoken among the population, Belize is the only country in Central America where English is the official language. Belize is bordered by Mexico to its north, by Guatemala to its south and west, and by the Caribbean Sea to the east.
With 8,867 square miles (22,960&amp;#160;km&amp;#178;) of land and 320,000 people (2008 est.), the population density of Belize is the lowest in the Central American region, and it also has one of the lowest population densities in the world. However, the country&#39;s population growth rate, 2.21% (2008 est.), is the highest in the region and one of the highest in the western hemisphere. Belize&#39;s abundance of biologically significant and unique ecosystems contributes to Mesoamerica&#39;s designation as a biodiversity &quot;hotspot&quot;.
Belize is culturally unique among Central American nations. It is the only nation in Central America with a British colonial heritage. Despite this, Belize considers itself to be a Central American nation affiliated with both the Caribbean and Latin America.

One of the town&#39;s historic sections experienced a renaissance in 2004. The Match Factory (officially the Pennsylvania Match Company), after standing vacant since 1947, was being renovated by the American Philatelic Society as their new home, one building at a time.

The government was moved to Belmopan in 1970, and its National Assembly Building is designed to resemble a Pre-Columbian Maya temple.
After Hurricane Hattie, with winds of up to 300&amp;#160;kilometres per hour (190&amp;#160;mph), and following the destruction of approximately 75% of the houses and business places in Belize City, the government of the day proposed to encourage and promote the building of a new capital city. This new capital would be situated on better terrain, would entail no costly reclamation of land, and would also provide for an industrial area. In 1962, a committee chose the site now known as Belmopan, located 82 kilometres (51&amp;#160;miles) west of the old capital of Belize City.

It borders Togo to the west, Nigeria to the east and Burkina Faso and Niger to the north; its short coastline to the south leads to the Bight of Benin.
Its size is just over 110000 km with a population of almost 8,500,000. Its capital is the Yoruba founded city of Porto-Novo but the seat of government is the Fon city of Cotonou.
A democratic government between 1960 and 1972 was followed by a self-proclaimed &quot;Marxist-Leninist&quot; dictatorship between 1972 and 1991, which was highly repressive and led to economic collapse. Multiparty elections have taken place since 1991. About a third of the population live below the international poverty line of US$1.25 per day. Main income sources are subsistence agriculture and cotton.
During the colonial period and at independence, the country was known as Dahomey. It was renamed on November 30, 1975, to Benin after the body of water on which the country lies, the Bight of Benin, which had in turn been named after the Benin Empire. The country of Benin has no direct connection to Benin City in modern Nigeria, nor to the Benin bronzes.
The new name, Benin,&lt;/p&gt;

With a population of 3.4 million people, Berlin is Germany&#39;s largest city. It is the second most populous city proper and the eighth most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany, it is the center of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Area, comprising 5 million people from over 190 nations. Geographically embedded in the European Plains, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one third of the city&#39;s territory is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes.
First documented in the 13th century, Berlin was successively the capital of the Kingdom of Prussia (1701&amp;#8211;1918), the German Empire (1871&amp;#8211;1918), the Weimar Republic (1919&amp;#8211;1933) and the Third Reich (1933&amp;#8211;1945). During the 1920s, Berlin was the third largest municipality in the world. After World War II, the city was divided; East Berlin became the capital of East Germany while West Berlin became a de facto West German exclave, surrounded by the Berlin Wall (1961&amp;#8211;1989).

She was a regular character in the show for all but the second of its seven seasons.
Gates McFadden was replaced during the second season, and the character of Dr. Katherine Pulaski, played by Diana Muldaur, was added as the USS Enterprise-D&#39;s chief medical officer. On the show, Crusher&#39;s absence was explained due to her being promoted to head of Starfleet medical. Citing a lack of chemistry between Muldaur and the rest of the cast, McFadden and her character returned to the show from season 3 on, to re-replace Pulaski.
Dr. Crusher is the chief medical officer on board the USS Enterprise-D and its successor, the USS Enterprise-E. Crusher held the rank of Commander, and was the head of Starfleet Medical during 2365.
She has one son, Wesley, with her late husband, Jack Crusher.

Birmingham was founded in 1871, just after the American Civil War, through the merger of three pre-existing towns, and Birmingham grew from there, annexing many more of its smaller neighbors, into an industrial and railroad transportation powerhouse, especially in mining, the iron and steel industry, and railroading. Birmingham was named for Birmingham, England, one of the major iron and steel industrial cities of Great Britain.
From its founding though the end of the 1960s, Birmingham was the primary industrial center of the Southern United States.

North of the city, a fertile and gently undulating steppe extends far north into neighboring Kazakhstan. The Chui River drains most of the area.

It is bordered by Brazil to the North and East, Paraguay and Argentina to the South, and Chile and Peru to the West.
Prior to European colonization, the Andean region of Bolivia was a part of the Inca Empire, which was the largest state in Pre-Columbian America. The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century. During most of the Spanish colonial period, this territory was called Upper Peru or Charcas and was under the administration of the Viceroyalty of Peru, which included most of Spain&#39;s South American colonies. After declaring independence in 1809, 16 years of war followed before the establishment of the Republic, named for Sim&amp;#243;n Bol&amp;#237;var, on August 6, 1825. Bolivia has struggled through periods of political instability, dictatorships and economic woes.
Bolivia is a Democratic Republic, divided into nine departments. Its geography is varied from the peaks of the Andes in the West, to the Eastern Lowlands, situated within the Amazon Basin. It is a developing country, with a Medium Human Development Index score, and a poverty level around 60%. Its main&lt;/p&gt;

Starting in 1998, many national government institutions were moved from Bonn to Berlin. Both houses of the German national parliament, the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, were moved along with the Chancellery and the residence of the President of Germany.
Bonn remains a centre of politics and administration, however. Roughly half of all government jobs were retained as many government departments remained in Bonn and numerous sub-ministerial level government agencies relocated to the former capital from Berlin and other parts of Germany. In recognition of this, the former capital now holds the title of Federal City (&quot;Bundesstadt&quot;).
Bonn has developed into a hub of international cooperation in particular in the area of environment and sustainable development. In addition to a number of other international organizations and institutions, such as, for instance, the IUCN Environmental&lt;/p&gt;

It is also one of Canada&#39;s fastest growing municipalities, with an average annual growth rate (2001&amp;#8211;2006) of 6.6%. With a median age at 33.7, it is the youngest community in the GTA. Brampton was incorporated as a village in 1853, taking its name from the rural town of Brampton, Cumbria, England. Visible minorities, combined, now form a large portion of the population.
Brampton was once known as The Flowertown of Canada, a title it earned due to the city&#39;s large greenhouse industry. This included Dale&#39;s Flowers, a company that won many international rose awards for nearly half a century. Today, the city&#39;s major economic sectors include advanced manufacturing, retail administration and logistics, information and communication technologies, food and beverage, life sciences and business services.

In 1952, De Wilde acted in the film Shane as Joey Starrett and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. He had the lead role in his own television series, Jamie (1953-1954), which, although popular, was cancelled due to a contract dispute. In 1956 he was featured with Walter Brennan, Phil Harris, and Sidney Poitier in the coming-of-age movie Good-bye, My Lady, adapted from James Street&#39;s book.

Brantford is connected to Woodstock in the west and Hamilton in the east by Highway 403 and to Cambridge to the north and Simcoe to the south by Highway 24.
Brantford is sometimes known by the nickname The Telephone City as former city resident Alexander Graham Bell conducted the first distant telephone call from the community to Paris, Ontario in 1876. It is also the birthplace of hockey player Wayne Gretzky.
The Attawandaron, or Neutral Nation, lived in the Grand River valley area before the 17th century; their main village and seat of the chief, Kandoucho, was identified by 19th-century historians as having been located on the Grand River where Brantford lies today. This town, like the rest of their settlements, was destroyed when the Iroquois declared war in 1650 and exterminated the Neutral nation.

Dannelly was born in W&amp;#252;rzburg, Germany before moving with his family to Baltimore, Maryland aged eleven. He attended a Catholic elementary school, Arlington Baptist High School in Baltimore, and a Jewish summer camp. He was expelled from first grade for hitting a nun, and later expelled from high school&amp;#8212;which he describes as &quot;one of the strictest schools in the nation&quot;&amp;#8212;for excessive demerits. He started questioning his sexuality in high school, claiming, &quot;I remember I&#39;d pray every night that I wasn&#39;t gay, and please God, please God, anything I could do&amp;#8212;just don&#39;t make this happen.&quot; He came out at the age of seventeen and was thrown out of his house by his parents, who eventually came to accept his sexuality.
Dannelly wrote and directed short film &quot;He Bop&quot; in 2000 before his debut with 2004&#39;s religious satire film Saved!, which he directed and co-wrote with Michael Urban. He had begun to write the Saved! script after the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, which he claims took him &quot;back to [his] roots&quot; in a Christian high school. He and Urban began writing the script&lt;/p&gt;

Dennehy was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the son of Hannah and Edward Dennehy, who was a wire service doctor for the Associated Press; he has two brothers, Michael and Edward. The family relocated to Long Island, New York, where Dennehy attended Chaminade High School in the town of Mineola.
Rather than immediately chase his dreams of stage and screen, Dennehy enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1959, actively serving until 1963. Although he said in numerous interviews that he had fought in Vietnam during the Vietnam War, even telling harrowing tales of his service there, it was revealed in the 1998 book Stolen Valor by B.G. Burkett that Dennehy had never served overseas at all during his time in the military. Later that year, Dennehy admitted to the tabloid The Globe &quot;I lied about serving in Vietnam and I&#39;m sorry. That was very wrong of me. There is no real excuse for that. I was a peace-time Marine, and I got out in 1963 without ever serving in Vietnam. I started the story that I had been in &#39;Nam, and I got stuck with it. Then I didn&#39;t know how to set the record straight.&quot; However, in&lt;/p&gt;

The city is part of the New York combined statistical area and is the fifth largest city in New England.
Bridgeport is also the center of the 41st largest urban area in the United States, just behind Austin, Texas (40th).
The city is marked by its attachment to its famous resident, the circus-promoter and once mayor P.T. Barnum. Barnum built three houses in the city, and housed his circus in town during winters.
Other than Black Rock and parts of Brooklawn which were originally part of the Town of Fairfield, Bridgeport was originally a part of the Town of Stratford. The first settlement was made in 1659. It was called Pequonnock until 1695, when its name was changed to Stratfield, because of its location between the already existing towns of Stratford and Fairfield. During the American Revolution it was a center of privateering. In 1800, the borough of Bridgeport was chartered, and in 1821 the township was incorporated. The city was not chartered until&lt;/p&gt;

It used to be bounded by a village named Mile-End to the north, however this district seems to have vanished over the years, resulting in Bridgeton&#39;s boundary moving north to Crownpoint Road. It started as a small weaving village in 1705, when the third John Walkinshaw marked out a portion of his Goosefauld estate for rent. However not much interest was shown until 1775 when Rutherglen Bridge was constructed across the River Clyde and the area became known as Bridge Town. A major employer was carpet manufacturer James Templeton &amp;amp; Co.
Bridgeton&#39;s most notable feature is the &quot;Brigton Umbrella&quot;, a Victorian cast iron structure covering the centre of Bridgeton Cross. Bridgeton also has one of Glasgow&#39;s original Carnegie libraries, deftly designed by the Invernessian architect, James Robert Rhind.

She retired in 1994, though had a minor role in the 1998 film Bishonen.
She was born in Taipei, and was &quot;discovered&quot; in 1972 by a film producer, and first appeared in many Taiwanese romance films based on the novels of Qiong Yao, also known as Chiung Yao. She later switched over to making adult movies in Hong Kong. At the height of her popularity she was arguably one of the most sought after actresses in the Chinese film industry. She starred in more than 100 movies.
In Taiwan movies, Lin was almost always cast as the female protagonist in the Qiong Yao based movies she appeared in. Her film roles were often that of the ideal girl next door who everyone liked and all men wanted to be with. Her characters often will find love and then - when about to get married - or having just married - tragedy will strike. Often the tragedy is either her fiance&#39;s or husband&#39;s mother disapproves of her, her fiance or husband contracts some serious disease, her fiance or husband falls from a high place at his construction site job, she falls pregnant and is left in a coma, or&lt;/p&gt;

There are slight regional variations in formal written English in the United Kingdom (for example, although the words wee and little are interchangeable in some contexts, one is more likely to see wee written by someone from northern Britain (and especially Scotland) or from Northern Ireland than by someone from Southern England or Wales). Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in written English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described as &quot;British English&quot;. The forms of spoken English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, and a uniform concept of &quot;British English&quot; is therefore more difficult to apply to the spoken language.

Apart from its coastline with the South China Sea it is completely surrounded by the state of Sarawak, Malaysia, and in fact it is separated into two parts by Limbang, which is part of Sarawak.
Brunei can trace its beginnings to the 7th century when it was a subject state of the Srivijayan empire under the name Po-ni. It later became a vassal state of Majapahit before embracing Islam in the 15th century. At the peak of its empire, the sultanate had control that extended over the coastal regions of modern-day Sarawak and Sabah, the Sulu archipelago, and the islands off the northwest tip of Borneo. The thalassocracy was visited by Ferdinand Magellan in 1521 and fought the Castille War in 1578 against Spain. Its empire began to decline with the forced ceding of Sarawak to James Brooke and the ceding of Sabah to the British North Borneo Chartered Company. After the loss of Limbang, Brunei finally became a British&lt;/p&gt;

Bucharest was first mentioned in documents as early as 1459. Since then it has gone through a variety of changes, becoming the state capital of Romania in 1862 and steadily consolidating its position as the centre of the Romanian mass media, culture and arts. Its eclectic architecture is a mix of historical (neo-classical), interbellum (Bauhaus and Art Deco), Communist-era and modern. In the period between the two World Wars, the city&#39;s elegant architecture and the sophistication of its elite earned Bucharest the nickname of the &quot;Little Paris of the East&quot; (Micul Paris). Although many buildings and districts in the historic centre were damaged or destroyed by war, earthquakes and Nicolae Ceau&amp;#537;escu&#39;s program of systematization, many survived. In recent years, the city has been experiencing an economic and cultural boom.

It is located on the western shore of the estuary of the R&amp;#237;o de la Plata, on the southeastern coast of the South American continent. The city of Buenos Aires is not part of Buenos Aires Province, nor is it its capital; rather, it is an autonomous federal district. Greater Buenos Aires is the third-largest conurbation in Latin America, with a population of around 13 million. Buenos Aires is considered an Alpha World City listed by the Loughborough University group&#39;s (GaWC) 2008 inventory.
After the internal conflicts of the 19th century, Buenos Aires was federalised and removed from Buenos Aires Province in 1880. The city limits were enlarged to include the former towns of Belgrano and Flores, which are both now neighbourhoods of the city.
Buenos Aires (English: Fair Winds or Good Air (see Names of Buenos Aires)) was originally named after the sanctuary of &quot;Nostra Signora di Bonaria&quot; (Italian for &quot;Our Lady of Bonaria&quot;) in Cagliari, Sardinia. In the 1994 constitution the city became autonomous, hence its&lt;/p&gt;

It is the third-largest city in British Columbia by population, surpassed only by nearby Surrey and Vancouver itself.
It was incorporated in 1892 and achieved City status in 1992, one hundred years after incorporation. It is the current seat of the Metro Vancouver government.
In the first 30 to 40 years after its incorporation, the growth of Burnaby was influenced by its location between expanding urban centres of Vancouver and New Westminster. It first served as a rural agricultural area supplying nearby markets. Later, it served as an important transportation corridor between Vancouver, the Fraser Valley and the Interior and continues to do so. As Vancouver expanded and became a metropolis, it was one of the first-tier bedroom community suburbs of Vancouver itself, along with North Vancouver and Richmond (originally it was primarily a suburb of New Westminster).

Its size is just under 28,000&amp;#160;km&amp;#178; with an estimated population of almost	8,700,000. Its capital is Bujumbura.

The Twa, Tutsi, and Hutu peoples have occupied Burundi since the country&#39;s formation five centuries ago. Burundi was ruled as a kingdom by the Tutsi for over two hundred years. However, at the beginning of the twentieth century, Germany and Belgium occupied the region, and Burundi and Rwanda became a European colony known as Ruanda-Urundi.
Political unrest occurred throughout the region because of social differences between the Tutsi and Hutu, provoking civil war in Burundi throughout the middle twentieth century.

He was best known for his silent films, in which his trademark was physical comedy with a consistently stoic, deadpan expression, earning him the nickname &quot;The Great Stone Face&quot;. 
Keaton was recognized as the seventh-greatest director of all time by Entertainment Weekly. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Keaton the 21st-greatest male actor of all time. Critic Roger Ebert wrote of Keaton&#39;s &quot;extraordinary period from 1920 to 1929, [when] he worked without interruption on a series of films that make him, arguably, the greatest actor-director in the history of the movies.&quot; Orson Welles has stated that Keaton&#39;s The General is the greatest comedy ever made, the greatest Civil War film ever made, and perhaps the greatest film ever made. A 2002 worldwide poll by Sight &amp;amp; Sound ranked Keaton&#39;s The General as the 15th best film of all time. Three other Keaton films received votes in the magazine&#39;s survey: Our Hospitality, Sherlock, Jr., and The Navigator.
Keaton was born Joseph Frank Keaton into a vaudeville family. He was named &quot;Joseph&quot; to&lt;/p&gt;

It is located in the south of the province, in a region of foothills and high plains, approximately  east of the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies. Calgary is the third largest civic municipality, by population, in Canada. As of the 2007 civic census, Calgary&#39;s population was 1,019,942. The metropolitan population (CMA) was 1,079,310 in 2006, making Greater Calgary the fifth largest census metropolitan area in the country. Because it is located 300&amp;#65474;&amp;#65440;kilometres (185&amp;#65474;&amp;#65440;mi) due south of Edmonton, statisticians define the narrow populated region between these cities as the &quot;Calgary-Edmonton Corridor&quot;. It is the largest Canadian metropolitan area between Toronto and Vancouver. 

A resident of Calgary is known as a Calgarian. 

Calgary is well-known as a destination for winter sport and ecotourism with a number of major mountain resorts near the city and metropolitan area. Economic activity in Calgary is mostly centred on the petroleum industry; however, agriculture, tourism, and high-tech industries also contribute to the city&#39;s fast economic growth.

He started his career in Canadian film and television projects, where his portrayal of Stanley Raymond Kowalski in the TV series Due South was his first international success. After years acting in over ninety Canadian and international projects he became widely known for his portrayal of the Cylon Leoben Conoy in the reimagined Battlestar Galactica, and following that, his role as record producer Lew Ashby in the Showtime TV series Californication.
Regularly cast as a bad guy in movies and even more often in his numerous guest appearances in television series, his participation to Canadian productions gives him an opportunity to show a broader palette of his acting abilities, which have been recognized by several awards.
Rennie was born to Scottish parents in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, an industrial city in North East England. When he was four years old, the family emigrated to Canada. Rennie was raised in middle-class Edmonton, Alberta, as the second of three boys. He graduated from Strathcona High School, where he met and befriended Bruce McCulloch from Kids in the Hall.

Cameroon&#39;s coastline lies on the Bight of Bonny, part of the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean.

The highest point is Mount Cameroon in the southwest, and the largest cities are Douala, Yaound&amp;#233;, and Garoua. Cameroon is home to over 200 different ethnic and linguistic groups. The country is well known for its native styles of music, particularly makossa and bikutsi, and for its successful national football team. English and French are the official languages.
Early inhabitants of the territory included the Sao civilisation around Lake Chad and the Baka hunter-gatherers in the southeastern rainforest.

It is the world&#39;s second largest country by total area. Canada&#39;s common border with the United States to the south and northwest is the longest in the world.
The land occupied by Canada was inhabited for millennia by various groups of Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the late 15th century, British and French expeditions explored, and later settled, along the Atlantic coast. France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 after the Seven Years&#39; War. In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom. This widening autonomy was highlighted by the Statute of Westminster of 1931 and culminated in the Canada Act of 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament.
A federation consisting of ten provinces and three territories, Canada is governed&lt;/p&gt;

The site of Canberra was selected for the location of the nation&#39;s capital in 1908 as a compromise between rivals Sydney and Melbourne, Australia&#39;s two largest cities. It is unusual among Australian cities, being an entirely planned city. Following an international contest for the city&#39;s design, a design by the Chicago architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin was selected and construction commenced in 1913.
The city&#39;s design was heavily influenced by the garden city movement and incorporates significant areas of natural vegetation that have earned Canberra the title &quot;bush capital&quot;.

The English name &quot;Cantonese&quot; often refers specifically to the dialect of Guangzhou, Hong Kong and Macau, which has emerged as the prestige variety of Yue. (See Cantonese.)
The issue of whether Yue should be regarded as a language in its own right or as a dialect of a Chinese language depends on conceptions of what a language is. Like the other primary branches of Chinese, Yue is considered to be a dialect of a single Chinese language for ethnic, political and cultural reasons, but is also considered a language in its own right because it is mutually unintelligible with other varieties of Chinese.
The areas with the highest concentration of speakers are Guangdong and parts of Guangxi in southern mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau; with Cantonese- and Taishanese-speaking minorities in Southeast Asia, Canada, Australia and the United States.
The prototypical use of the name &quot;Cantonese&quot; in English is for the Guangzhou (Canton) dialect of Yue, but it is commonly used for Yue&lt;/p&gt;

The town was founded in the late 18th century, and grew rapidly throughout the 19th century due to the expansion of the local textile industry. It was popular as a tourist resort from the early Victorian era up to the latter half of the 20th century, due to its seaside location. It is best known for its associations with golf.
Carnoustie can be considered a dormitory town for its closest city, Dundee, which is 11&amp;#160;miles (18&amp;#160;km) to the west. It is served by Carnoustie railway station, and less so by Golf Street railway station. Its nearest major road is the A92.
The origin of the name Carnoustie is uncertain, although it possibly derives from the Gaelic C&amp;#224;rn fheusta, meaning &#39;fort of the feast&#39;. It is also possible that it has an earlier Pictish origin, predating the gaelicisation of Angus.

The territory comprises the islands of Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac, and Little Cayman, located south of Cuba and northwest of Jamaica. The territory is a major offshore financial centre in the Caribbean.
The Cayman Islands were sighted by Christopher Columbus, on 10 May 1503 on his fourth and final voyage to the New World. He named the islands Las Tortugas after the numerous sea turtles there. The first recorded English visitor to the islands was Sir Francis Drake, who landed there in 1586 and named them the Cayman Islands after caiman, the Neo-Taino nations&#39; term for alligator.
The first recorded permanent inhabitant of the Cayman Islands, Isaac Bodden, was born on Grand Cayman around 1661. He was the grandson of the original settler named Bodden who was probably one of Oliver Cromwell&#39;s soldiers at the taking of Jamaica in 1655.
The Cayman Islands remained largely uninhabited until the 17th century. A variety of people settled on the islands, including pirates, refugees from the Spanish Inquisition, shipwrecked sailors, deserters from Oliver Cromwell&#39;s army&lt;/p&gt;

It is bordered by Libya to the north, Sudan to the east, the Central African Republic to the south, Cameroon and Nigeria to the southwest, and Niger to the west. Due to its distance from the sea and its largely desert climate, the country is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Dead Heart of Africa&quot;.
Chad is divided into three major geographical regions: a desert zone in the north, an arid Sahelian belt in the centre and a more fertile Sudanese savanna zone in the south. Lake Chad, after which the country is named, is the largest wetland in Chad and the second largest in Africa. Chad&#39;s highest peak is the Emi Koussi in the Sahara, and N&#39;Djamena, (formerly Fort-Lamy), the capital, is the largest city. Chad is home to over 200 different ethnic and linguistic groups. Arabic and French are the official languages. Islam and Christianity are the most widely practiced religions.
Beginning in the 7th millennium BC, human populations moved into the Chadian basin in great numbers. By the end of the 1st millennium BC, a series of states and empires rose and fell in Chad&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;

They include two separate bailiwicks: the Bailiwick of Guernsey and the Bailiwick of Jersey, neither of which is part of the United Kingdom; rather they are considered the remnants of the Duchy of Normandy. They have a total population of about 158,000 and their respective capitals, St. Peter Port and St. Helier, have populations of 16,488 and 28,310. The total area of the islands is 209.25&amp;#160;km squared.
The Bailiwicks have been administered separately from each other since the late 13th century, and although those unacquainted with the islands often assume they form one political unit, common institutions are the exception rather than the rule. The two Bailiwicks have no common laws, no common elections, and no common representative body (although their politicians consult regularly). There is no common newspaper or radio station, but a common television station, ITV Channel Television, as well as a common BBC television news opt-out BBC Channel Islands News.

Laughton was best known for his historical roles in films, but he started his career as a remarkable stage actor, during a time when many serious stage actors despised the motion picture medium, seeing it only as a source of income. Laughton showed keen and serious interest in the pioneering possibilities of film, and later other media, such as radio, recordings, and TV, proving that quality work could be made available to audiences other than theatre-goers. He became an American citizen in 1950.
Laughton was born in Scarborough, Yorkshire, England, the son of Robert Laughton, a Yorkshire hotel keeper, and his wife Elizabeth (n&amp;#233;e Conlon). His mother was a devout Roman Catholic and he attended Stonyhurst College, a Jesuit school, in Lancashire, England. He served during World War I (in which he was gassed) first with the 2/1st Battalion of the Huntingdonshire Cyclist Regiment and later with the 7th Battalion of the Northamptonshire Regiment.
He started work in the family hotel business, while participating in amateur theatricals in Scarborough. Finally&lt;/p&gt;

He was the older brother of comedian/director James Parrott.
Born Charles Joseph Parrott in Baltimore, Maryland, Chase began performing in vaudeville as a teenager and started his career in films by working at the Christie Comedies in 1912. He then moved to Keystone Studios, where he began appearing in bit parts in the Mack Sennett films, including those of Charlie Chaplin. By 1915 he was playing juvenile leads in the Keystones, and directing some of the films as Charles Parrott. His Keystone credentials were good enough to get him steady work as a comedy director with other companies; he directed many of Chaplin imitator Billy West&#39;s comedies, which featured a young Oliver Hardy as villain.
In 1920, Chase began working as a film director for Hal Roach Studios; among his notable early works for Roach was supervising the first entries in the Our Gang series, as well as directing several films starring Lloyd Hamilton; like many other silent comedians, Chase is reported to have regarded Hamilton&#39;s work as a major influence&lt;/p&gt;

Heston is known for having played heroic roles, such as Moses in The Ten Commandments, Colonel George Taylor in Planet of the Apes, El Cid in El Cid, and Judah Ben-Hur in Ben-Hur, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor. In the 1950s and 1960s he was one of a handful of Hollywood actors to speak openly against racism and was an active supporter of the Civil Rights Movement. Initially a moderate Democrat, he later supported conservative Republican policies and was president of the National Rifle Association from 1998 to 2003.
Heston was born John Charles Carter, the only child of Lilla (n&amp;#233;e Charlton; 1899&amp;#8211;1994) and Russell Whitford Carter (1897&amp;#8211;1966), a mill operator.

Heston&#39;s autobiography, however, and some other sources place his birth in No Man&#39;s Land, Illinois, which usually refers to a then-unincorporated area now part of Wilmette, Illinois, a well-off northern suburb of Chicago.

Its metropolitan area, commonly named &quot;Chicagoland&quot;, is the 26th most populous in the world, home to an estimated 9.7 million people spread across the U.S. states of Illinois, Wisconsin, and Indiana. Chicago is primarily located within Cook County, with the exception of a small northwestern portion of the city at O&#39;Hare International Airport that is located within DuPage County.
Chicago was founded in 1833, near a portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed. The Potawatomi were forcibly removed from their land following the Treaty of Chicago. The city became a major transportation and telecommunications hub in North America. Today, the city retains its status as a major hub, both for industry and infrastructure, with O&#39;Hare International Airport being the second busiest airport in the world. In 2008, the city hosted 45.6 million domestic and overseas visitors.
In modern times, the city has taken on an additional dimension as a center for business and&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Chihiro Ogino is the protagonist in the animated film, Spirited Away. She has a very sullen, and no-nonsense personality. She is none too thrilled about the move her family makes at the beginning of the film, nor the subsequent detour her father makes into what appears to be an abandoned amusement park. Her misgivings about the &quot;park&quot; are confirmed when her parents are transformed into pigs after eating enchanted food, which Chihiro herself refused to eat. She drops her more serious persona at this point and behaves like the frightened child she is. After discovering, from a mysterious boy-like spirit called Haku, that the park is in fact a sort of resort for Japanese gods, Chihiro gets a job at the resort&#39;s bathhouse, which will be the backdrop for her own story of emotional growth. 

Chihiro was voiced by child star Daveigh Chase in the American version.

It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. With Ecuador, it is one of two countries in South America which do not border Brazil. The Pacific coastline of Chile is 6,435 kilometres. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fern&amp;#225;ndez, Salas y G&amp;#243;mez, Desventuradas and Easter Island. Chile also claims about 1,250,000&amp;#160;square kilometres (480,000&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi) of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty.
The very shape of Chile is distinctive, a multi-coloured ribbon of land 4,300&amp;#160;kilometres (2,700&amp;#160;mi) long and on average 175&amp;#160;kilometres (109&amp;#160;mi) wide. Its climate varies, ranging from the world&#39;s driest desert-the Atacama-in the north, through a Mediterranean climate in the centre, to a rainy temperate climate in the south. The northern desert contains great mineral wealth, principally copper. The relatively small central area&lt;/p&gt;

In 1949, when major combat ended in the Chinese Civil War, two political entities emerged having the term &quot;China&quot; in their names:
China is one of the world&#39;s oldest continuous civilizations. In the 19th and 20th century, imperialism, wars and civil wars damaged the country and its economy. In the 1950s, change to economic policies in the Republic of China (Taiwan) transformed the island into a technology-oriented industrialized developed economy. It became known as one of the Four Asian Tigers along with Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore. In mainland China, in the 1970s, reforms known as the Four Modernizations modernized the agriculture, industry, technology and defense, eventually making the PRC one of the major powers. China is viewed as the source of many major inventions. It has also one of the world&#39;s oldest written language systems.
Historically, China&#39;s cultural sphere has extended across East Asia as a whole, with Chinese religion, customs, and writing systems being adopted to varying degrees by neighbors such as Japan, Korea and Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

He began as an actor and martial arts instructor working in Hong Kong action cinema in the 1960s and 1970s (his father, Ching Gong, was a Shaw Studios director, and Ching Siu-tung had been trained in Peking opera as a child), but he made his directorial debut in 1982 with the ground-breaking wuxia classic Duel to the Death.
He worked with producer Tsui Hark on 1987&#39;s A Chinese Ghost Story, which became an international sensation, although it was usually Tsui Hark who took most of the plaudits. He continued to work with Tsui Hark, directing sequels to that film in 1990 and 1991, and co-directing all three parts of the Swordsman series, starting in 1990. Other directorial highlights included the highly successful Royal Tramp films (both 1992) which starred Stephen Chow and Brigitte Lin.

It is also its main industrial and commercial centre and is located in the middle of the country, on the river B&amp;#238;c. The population of the city is 592,900 (2007) which grows to 911,400 in the entire metropolitan area.
Chi&amp;#351;in&amp;#259;u is the most economically prosperous locality in Moldova, and its largest transportation hub. As the most economically and socially important municipality in Moldova, the city has a broad range of educational facilities. The proportion of green spaces in Chi&amp;#351;in&amp;#259;u is one of the highest among major European cities.
According to one version, the name comes from the archaic Romanian word chi&amp;#351;la (meaning &quot;spring&quot;, &quot;source of water&quot;) and nou&amp;#259; (&quot;new&quot;), because it was built around a small spring. Nowadays, the spring is located at the corner of Pushkin and Albi&amp;#351;oara streets.
An alternative version, by Stefan Ciobanu, Romanian historian and academician, holds it, that the name was formed the same way as the name of Chi&amp;#351;ineu (alternative spelling: Chi&amp;#351;in&amp;#259;u) in Western Romania, near the border&lt;/p&gt;

Historically, it was Gia &amp;#272;&amp;#7883;nh (1779-1832), Nam K&amp;#7923; (1834-1945), Nam B&amp;#7897; (1945-48), Nam ph&amp;#7847;n (1948-56), Nam Vi&amp;#7879;t (1956-75), and later Mi&amp;#7873;n Nam. In French, it was called la colonie de Cochinchine.
In the 17th century, Vietnam was divided between the Tr&amp;#7883;nh Lords to the north and the Nguy&amp;#7877;n Lords to the south. The northern section was called Tonkin by Europeans, and the southern part called Cochinchina by most Europeans and Quinam by the Dutch.
During the French colonial period, the label moved further south, and came to refer to the southernmost part of Vietnam, controlled by Cambodia in prior centuries, and lying to its southeast. Its capital was at Saigon. The two other parts of Vietnam at the time were known as Annam and Tonkin.
The name &quot;Cochin&quot; derives from the Malay Kuchi which referred to all of Vietnam. This term was in turn derived from the Chinese jiao zhi, pronounced giao ch&amp;#7881; in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

Cockburn Town is located on the largest island in the Turks Islands (not the Caicos) archipelago, Grand Turk Island. Historic 18th and 19th century Bermudian architecture line Duke and Front Streets in Cockburn Town. The town is known for its long, narrow streets and old street lamps.
The closest anchorage to Cockburn Town is Hawk&#39;s Nest Anchorage, which, though sheltered, should only be entered in good light because of reefs near the entrance.
The seat of government ever since 1766, Cockburn Town was the first permanent settlement on any of the islands, founded in 1681 by salt collectors who arrived in the Turks and Caicos Islands. The city supposedly lies on the place where Juan Ponce de Le&amp;#243;n first landed on the island.
Cockburn Town is home to the Turks &amp;amp; Caicos National Museum, which is housed in the colonial-era Guinep House, on Front Street. The house is believed to be over 180 years old and much of its structural material came from local shipwrecks, including a ship&#39;s mast, which is one of the building&#39;s main supports. The site was donated to the Museum in 1990..

Originally situated on Tombo Island, one of the &amp;#206;les de Los, it has since spread up the neighboring Kaloum Peninsula.
The population of Conakry is difficult to ascertain, although the U.S. Bureau of African Affairs has estimated it at 2 million. Even given this uncertainty, Conakry makes up almost a quarter of the population of Guinea.
According to a legend, the name of the city comes from the fusion of the name &quot;Cona&quot;, a wine and cheese producer of the Baga people, and the word &quot;nakiri&quot;, which means in Sosso the other bank or side.
Conakry was originally settled on tiny Tombo Island and later spread to the neighboring Kaloum Peninsula, a 36-kilometer (22&amp;#160;mi) long stretch of land 0.2 to 6 kilometers (660 to 20,000&amp;#160;ft) wide. The city was essentially founded after Britain ceded the island to France in 1887. In 1885, the two island villages of Conakry and Boubinet had fewer than 500 inhabitants.

Although it is commonly known in English as Ivory Coast, the Ivorian government officially discourages this usage, preferring the French name C&amp;#244;te d&#39;Ivoire to be used in all languages. It has an area of 322,462&amp;#160;km, and borders the countries of Liberia, Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso and Ghana; its southern boundary is along the Gulf of Guinea. The country&#39;s population, which was 15,366,672 in 1998, is estimated to be 20,617,068 in 2009.
Prior to its occupation by Europeans, C&amp;#244;te d&#39;Ivoire was home to several important states, including Gyaaman, the Kong Empire, and Baoul&amp;#233;. There were also two Agni kingdoms, Ind&amp;#233;ni&amp;#233; and Sanwi, which attempted to retain their separate identity through the French colonial period and even after C&amp;#244;te d&#39;Ivoire&#39;s independence. An 1843&amp;#8211;1844 treaty made C&amp;#244;te d&#39;Ivoire a &quot;protectorate&quot; of France and in 1893, it became a French colony as part of the European scramble for Africa.
The state became independent on 7 August 1960. From 1960 to 1993, it was led by F&amp;#233;lix Houphou&amp;#235;t-Boigny. C&amp;#244;te d&#39;Ivoire maintained close&lt;/p&gt;

It lies on the A85 road between Perth and Crianlarich and also lies on the A822 between Greenloaning and Aberfeldy. The A822 joins onto the A823 which leads to Dunfermline.
In recent years Crieff has developed into a hub for tourism, trading mainly on its whisky and cattle droving history. Tourist attractions include the Caithness Glass Visitor Centre and Glenturret Distillery. Innerpeffray Library (established c. 1680), Scotland&#39;s oldest lending library, is also nearby. St. Mary&#39;s Chapel, adjacent to the library, dates from 1508. Both the library and chapel are open to the public: the library is run by a charitable trust, the chapel is in the care of Historic Scotland.
For a number of centuries the Highlanders came south to Crieff to sell their black cattle whose meat and hides were avidly sought by the growing urban populations in Lowland Scotland and the north of England. The town acted as a gathering point or tryst for the Michaelmas cattle sale held each year and the surrounding fields and hillsides were black with the tens of thousands of cattle - some from as far away as&lt;/p&gt;

It consists of the island of Cuba, the Isla de la Juventud, and several archipelagos. Havana is the largest city in Cuba and the country&#39;s capital. Santiago de Cuba is the second largest city.
Cuba is home to over 11 million people and is the most populous insular nation in the Caribbean. Its people, culture, and customs draw from diverse sources, including: the aboriginal Ta&amp;#237;no and Ciboney peoples; the period of Spanish colonialism; the introduction of African slaves; and its proximity to the United States.
The name &quot;Cuba&quot; comes from the Ta&amp;#237;no language and though the exact meaning is unclear, it may be translated either as &quot;where fertile land is abundant&quot; (cubao), or as &quot;great place&quot; (coabana). Another claim states that the name &quot;Cuba&quot; was given by Columbus after the ancient town of Cuba in the district of Beja in Portugal.
Before the arrival of the Spanish, the island was inhabited by Native American peoples known as the Ta&amp;#237;no and Ciboney whose ancestors migrated from the mainland of North, Central and South America&lt;/p&gt;

Cumberland was originally settled as part of Rehoboth, Massachusetts, which was purchased from the local Native Americans by the Plymouth Colony. It was later transferred to Rhode Island as part of a long-running boundary dispute.
William Blackstone (also spelled William Blaxton in colonial times) was the first European to have settled and lived in Cumberland. (He was also the first European to have settled in Boston, but left there when he and the newly arrived Puritans disagreed about religion.) He preached his brand of tolerant Christianity under an oak tree that became an inspiration to Christians worldwide. He lived on a farm in the Lonsdale area of Cumberland, where he cultivated the first variety of American apples, the Yellow Sweeting. The site of his home is now occupied by the Ann &amp;amp; Hope mill.
The popular tourist destination &quot;Nine Men&#39;s Misery&quot; is a tomb found on the grounds of a former Trappist monastery (Abbey of Our Lady of the Valley), part of which was destroyed in a fire in 1950. The Trappists sold the monastery and grounds to&lt;/p&gt;

As of the 2000 census, the city population was 49,374. It is currently the second largest city in Summit County. It is a suburb of Akron and Cleveland and part of the Akron Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Cleveland-Akron-Elyria Combined Statistical Area. Actually older than Akron, the city was founded in 1812 by William Wetmore and was originally named Manchester. Cuyahoga Falls is named after the Cuyahoga River (which flows into Lake Erie) and the series of falls that run through the middle of the city.
Cuyahoga Falls is bordered by Akron to the south and the Cuyahoga Valley National Park to the northwest.
Cuyahoga Falls was formed in 1812 near the junction of what was then Northampton, Stow, Tallmadge, and Portage townships. The focus was the series of Cuyahoga River waterfalls that provided power for manufacturing.
In 1812 Kelsey and Wilcox built a dam on the Cuyahoga River at a place where a railroad bridge crossed it in 1876. They then built a flour mill, an oil mill, and a saw mill. This led to the construction of a number of houses. This area was known as the old village. Development moved downstream,&lt;/p&gt;

After recovering from polio as a child, and studying ballet, Charisse entered films in the 1940s. Her roles usually focussed on her abilities as a dancer, and she was paired with Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly; her films include Singin&#39; in the Rain (1952), The Band Wagon (1953) and Silk Stockings (1957). She stopped dancing in films in the late 1950s, but continued acting in film and television, and in 1992 made her Broadway debut.
In her later years, she discussed the history of the Hollywood musical in documentaries, and participated in That&#39;s Entertainment! III in 1994. She was awarded the National Medal of the Arts and Humanities in 2006 and died two years later as a result of a heart attack.
Charisse was born as Tula Ellice Finklea in Amarillo, Texas, the daughter of Lela (n&amp;#233;e Norwood) and Ernest Enos Finklea, Sr., who was a jeweler. Her nickname &quot;Sid&quot; was taken from a sibling trying to say &quot;Sis&quot;. (It was later spelled &quot;Cyd&quot; at MGM to give her an air of mystery.) She was a sickly girl who started dancing lessons at six to build up her strength after a bout with polio. At 12, she studied ballet in Los&lt;/p&gt;

The Czech Republic has been a member of NATO since 1999 and of the European Union since 2004. The Czech Republic is also a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). As an OSCE participating State, the Czech Republic&amp;#8217;s international commitments are subject to monitoring under the mandate of the U.S. Helsinki Commission.

The Czech state or Bohemia (Lands of the Bohemian Crown) as it was known until 1918 was formed in the late 9th century. The country reached its greatest territorial extent during the 13th and 14th century under the rule of the P&amp;#345;emyslid and Luxembourg dynasties. Following the Battle of Moh&amp;#225;cs in 1526, the Kingdom of Bohemia was integrated into the Habsburg monarchy as one of its three principal parts alongside Austria&lt;/p&gt;

Its position, on the western edge of Africa (it is the westernmost city on the African mainland), is an advantageous departure point for trans-Atlantic and European trade; this fact aided its growth into a major regional port.
According to December 31, 2005 official estimates, the city of Dakar proper has a population of 1,030,594, whereas the population of the Dakar metropolitan area is estimated at 2.45&amp;#160;million people.
Dakar is a major administrative centre, home to the National Assembly of Senegal and Senegal&#39;s President&#39;s Palace.
The Cape Verde Peninsula was settled, no later than the 15th century, by the Lebou, an ethnic group related to the neighboring Wolof and Sereer. The original villages: Ouakam, Ngor, Yoff and Hann, still constitute distinctively Lebou neighborhoods of the city today. Meanwhile, in 1444, the Portuguese arrived on the island of Gor&amp;#233;e and founded a settlement there. By 1536, they had begun using it as a base for the export of slaves.

Vader originally appeared as the Empire&#39;s villainous enforcer in the original Star Wars trilogy (Episodes IV, V, VI), and briefly turns up as a tragic figure near the end of Revenge of the Sith, the third and final film of the Star Wars prequel trilogy (Episodes I, II, III). Lucas, in the audio commentary for Revenge of the Sith, says that he considers both trilogies together to be The Tragedy of Darth Vader.
In the original Star Wars trilogy, Vader is embodied by David Prowse, though Sebastian Shaw makes a brief appearance as the unmasked Vader in Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. In Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, Vader is played by Hayden Christensen. In the original trilogy and Episode III, James Earl Jones provides Vader&#39;s voice when he is masked, although Jones was originally uncredited for this role.
In the original trilogy, George Lucas depicts Darth Vader as a fearsome cyborg who acts as the supreme commander of the brutal Galactic Empire and right hand man of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). Throughout the films, Vader oppresses the galaxy&lt;/p&gt;

Hannah became interested in movies at a young age, partly due to insomnia. She was very shy and diagnosed as borderline autistic. Hannah attended the progressive Francis W. Parker School (where she played on the soccer team) before enrolling at the University of Southern California.
Hannah made her film debut in 1978 with a brief appearance in Brian De Palma&#39;s horror film The Fury. She turned down many roles early on in her career, including the role of Emmeline Lestrange for The Blue Lagoon (that ultimately went to&lt;/p&gt;

Some of his earliest work is for DC Comics&#39;s House of Secrets and a run on Swamp Thing (Vol. 1, #14-18, 21 and 22), following Len Wein and preceding Gerry Conway, illustrated by Nestor Redondo. Michelinie also did a run on Aquaman in Adventure Comics which led to the revival of the Sea King&#39;s own title in 1977. In the last story of the Adventure Comics, #452, Black Manta killed Arthur Curry Jr. by suffocation. The infant&#39;s death has affected the character ever since.
His most famous works include two noted runs on the Iron Man series, with co-writer (and inker) Bob Layton, in the late 1970s and early 1980s which introduced the character&#39;s serious problem with alcoholism, his specialized power armor variants and his new enmities with Justin Hammer and Victor Von Doom. He also introduced one of Stark&#39;s closest comrades, the fearless pilot, Jim Rhodes. His most noted cliffhanger was when Tony Stark was thrown out of S.H.I.E.L.D.&#39;s helicarrier and had to don his armor completely to use its flight function before he hit the ground.
In the late 1980s, he also wrote a popular run on The Amazing Spider-Man series which&lt;/p&gt;

In Britain, he is also remembered as having played the Green Cross Code man. Prowse is a native of Bristol, where he attended Bristol Grammar School.
Arguably, Prowse is best known for playing the physical form of Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy. He spoke the dialogue during the filming of the movie, and didn&#39;t actually know Vader was Luke&#39;s father until he saw the movie in the cinema. Though he was never going to be used as the voice of Darth Vader, he was originally told that he would be seen and heard at the end of Return of the Jedi when Vader&#39;s mask was removed. This did not end up happening as actor Sebastian Shaw was brought in instead. However, Lucas claims he wanted a &#39;darker voice&#39; (Lucas has stated that Darth Vader had to have a deep, reverberating voice) that Prowse could not provide and never intended to use Prowse&#39;s voice.

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Delmer Daves (July 24, 1904 &amp;#8211; August 17, 1977) was an American screenwriter, director, and producer.
Born in San Francisco, Delmer Daves first pursued a career as a lawyer. While attending Stanford University he became interested in the burgeoning film industry, first working as a prop boy on the 1923 western The Covered Wagon and serving as a technical advisor on a number of films. After finishing his education in law, he continued his career in Hollywood.
After moving to Hollywood in 1928, he began his career as a screenwriter, his first credit being the &quot;talkie&quot; comedy So This Is College released by MGM. Through the 1930s he made a name as a successful screenplay and story writer, while moonlighting as an actor in bit parts and uncredited roles. He penned the successful Dick Powell musicals Dames, Flirtation Walk, and Page Miss Glory between 1934 and 1935. Daves largest successes of the period, however, came with 1936&#39;s The Petrified Forest and Love Affair (1939). Almost twenty years later Leo McCarey, director of Love Affair, would helm the nearly identical An Affair to Remember (1957) using Daves&#39; script.
Daves made his directorial debut in the Cary Grant wartime adventure&lt;/p&gt;

After minor roles in film and a role in the television drama series General Hospital, Moore established her career in films such as St. Elmo&#39;s Fire (1985) and Ghost (1990) and in the early 1990s became one of the highest paid actresses in Hollywood following her successes in A Few Good Men (1992), Indecent Proposal (1993), Disclosure (1994), and The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996). By the end of the decade her films were less successful, but she returned to prominence with her role in Charlie&#39;s Angels: Full Throttle (2003).
Moore took her professional name from her first husband Freddy Moore and is the mother of three daughters from her marriage to Bruce Willis. She has been married to actor Ashton Kutcher since 2005 and later took his last name in 2009.
Moore was born Demi Gene Guynes in Roswell, New Mexico. As a child she had a difficult and unstable home life.

Farina was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Italian American parents Yolanda, a homemaker, and Joseph Farina, a Sicilian doctor. He was raised in a large family and has three brothers and three sisters.
Farina served 18 years as a policeman on the Chicago police force before becoming an actor. Farina himself has stated several times that his handgun skills while on the force were so poor that his fellow officers nick-named him &#39;The Great Wounder&#39;.
Farina began his work in show business working for director Michael Mann as a police consultant on Mann&#39;s early works. This led to an interest in acting when Mann cast him in a small role in the 1981 film Thief. Farina proceeded to moonlight as an actor in the Chicago theater scene before Mann chose him for his Crime Story series. Farina played the mobster Albert Lombard in Michael Mann&#39;s other television show Miami Vice.
Two of his most well-known movie characters are Jimmy Serrano, the mob boss from Midnight Run, and Ray &quot;Bones&quot; Barboni, a rival criminal of Chili Palmer&#39;s in Get Shorty. He&lt;/p&gt;

It is bordered by Eritrea in the north, Ethiopia in the west and south, and Somalia in the southeast. The remainder of the border is formed by the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.
The history of Djibouti is recorded in poetry, songs, and folklore of its nomadic people and goes back thousands of years to a time when Djiboutians traded hides and skins for the perfumes and spices of ancient Egypt, India, and China. Through close contacts with the Arabian peninsula for more than 1,000 years, the Somali and Afar ethnic groups in this region became among the first on the African continent to adopt Islam.
French interest developed in the nineteenth century when the area was ruled by the sultan of Raheita, Tadjoura and Gobaad. The French bought the anchorage of Obock in 1862 and expanded it eventually to a colony called French Somaliland with essentially the current boundaries. In 1967, the area became the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas.
The Republic of Djibouti gained its independence from France on June 27, 1977. Djibouti is a Somali, Afar and Muslim&lt;/p&gt;

Her high-pitched voice could be heard announcing the show&#39;s title at the beginning of each episode.
Born Dolores Goodman in Columbus, Ohio, Goodman was notoriously secretive about her age, successfully shaving off 15 years (giving a birthyear of 1929) for many years before the discrepancy was publicly debunked.
Goodman gained a measure of newspaper column space for her dancing solos in such Broadway musicals as High Button Shoes (1947), and Wonderful Town (1953). In 1955, she stopped the show in Off Broadway&#39;s Shoestring Revue with the novelty song &quot;Someone&#39;s Been Sending Me Flowers.&quot; She also headlined Off-Broadway in the Jerry Herman musical revue Parade in 1960 with Charles Nelson Reilly.

The Commonwealth of Dominica has an estimated population of 72,500. The capital is Roseau.
Dominica has been nicknamed the &quot;Nature Isle of the Caribbean&quot; for its seemingly unspoiled natural beauty. It is the youngest island in the Lesser Antilles, still being formed by geothermal-volcanic activity, as evidenced by the world&#39;s second-largest boiling lake. The island features lush mountainous rainforests, home of many rare plant, animal, and bird species. There are xeric areas in some of the western coastal regions, but heavy rainfall can be expected inland. The Sisserou Parrot (also known as the Imperial Amazon), the island&#39;s national bird, is featured on the national flag. Dominica&#39;s economy is heavily dependent on both tourism and agriculture.

Dorking began life as a small staging post on Stane Street, the Roman Road which linked London to Chichester on the English Channel.
Dorking appears in Domesday Book of 1086 as the Manor of Dorchinges. It was held by William the Conqueror. Its domesday assets were: one church, 3 mills worth 15s 4d, 16 ploughs, 3&amp;#160;acres (1.2&amp;#160;ha) of meadow, woodland and herbage worth 88 hogs. It rendered &amp;#163;18..
Subsequent Lords of the Manor were to include the Dukes of Norfolk, who lived in Dorking until they moved to Arundel. One of them is buried in Dorking churchyard. In the Medieval period, Dorking was a prosperous agricultural and market town, benefitting from its position on the junction of a number of important roads and tracks.
In 1750, the construction of a Turnpike Road made Dorking a staging post on the route to Brighton and the coast. The Bull&amp;#8217;s Head in South Street had a famous coachman, William Broad, whose portrait hangs in Dorking Museum in West Street. The inn that now dominates the centre of Dorking, the White Horse, was developed in the 18th century;&lt;/p&gt;

The CSO gives a figure of 18,192 for the parts of Douglas that lie within Cork County. No figure is provided for the parts within Cork City, although the combined population of the Tramore A, Tramore B and Tramore C electoral divisions, which lie in Douglas, is 5,001.
The name derives from the Irish words Dubh Ghlas, meaning Dark Stream, which still flows through the village. The stream flows into Cork Harbour.
Douglas was first mentioned in documents in 1251. By the mid-seventeenth century, it had a population of 308 people (of whom 33 were English) and consisted of a number of large farms. The area began to develop as an urban settlement in the early eighteenth century with the opening of Donnybrook Mills in 1726. The mills produced sail-cloth and supplied sails to the British Royal Navy amongst other clients. Huguenot weavers and textile workers, such as the Bernard and Pollock brothers from Belfast, came to&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Douglas (Manx: Doolish) is the capital and largest town of the Isle of Man, with a population of 26,218 people (2006). It is located at the mouth of the River Douglas, and a sweeping bay of two miles. The River Douglas forms part of the town&#39;s harbour and main commercial port.
Douglas is home to the High Courts and the Isle of Man Government.
The town serves as the Island&#39;s main hub for business, finance, shipping, transport, shopping, and entertainment.
The discovery of a bronze weapon in central Douglas, and the large Ballaquayle Viking treasure hoard on the outskirts, both in the 1890s, hint at the early importance of the site now occupied by Douglas. Scholars agree that the name of the town derives from Early Celtic &#39;Duboglassio&#39; meaning &#39;black river&#39; . Douglas is twice referred to in the Monastic &#39;Chronicle of the Kings of Man and the Isles&#39;; first in 1192, when the monks of St Mary&#39;s Abbey at Rushen, were transferred there for a four-year stay, then again in 1313, when Robert (Bruce), King of Scotland, spent the night at the &#39;monastery of Duglas&#39; on his way to seize Castle Rushen. These may be references to the site of the later Nunnery, a little upstream from the port.

It is one of the major metropolitan centres identified in the London Plan and is often referred to as the &quot;Queen of the Suburbs&quot;.
The Saxon name for Ealing was recorded c.700 as &#39;Gillingas&#39;, meaning &#39;place of the people associated with Gilla&#39;, from the personal name Gilla and the Old English suffix &#39;-ingas&#39;, meaning &#39;people of&#39;. Over the centuries, the name has changed, and has been known as &#39;Illing&#39;, 1130; &#39;Gilling&#39;, 1243; and &#39;Ylling&#39;, 1254, until &#39;Ealing&#39; became the standard spelling in the 19th century.
Archaeological evidence shows that parts of Ealing have been occupied for at least 7,000 years Iron Age pots have been discovered in the vicinity on Horsenden Hill. A settlement is recorded here in the 12th century amid a great forest that carpeted the area to the west of London. The earliest surviving English census is that for Ealing in 1599. This list was a tally of all 85 households in Ealing village giving the names of the inhabitants, together with their ages, relationships and occupations. It survives in manuscript form in the Public Record&lt;/p&gt;

Although he played a wide range of characters, he is best remembered for his roles as a gangster, most notably in his star-making film Little Caesar.
Born as Emanuel Goldenberg to a Yiddish-speaking Jewish family in Bucharest, he emigrated with his family to New York City in 1903. He had his Bar Mitzvah at First Romanian-American congregation, and attended Townsend Harris High School and then the City College of New York. An interest in acting led to him winning an American Academy of Dramatic Arts scholarship, after which he changed his name to Edward G. Robinson (the G. signifying his original last name). He served in the U.S. Navy during WWI.
He began his acting career in 1913 and made his Broadway debut in 1915. He made his film debut in a minor and uncredited role in 1916; in 1923 he made his named debut as E. G. Robinson in The Bright Shawl. One of many actors who saw his career flourish in the new sound film era rather than falter, he made only three films prior to 1930 but left his stage career that year and made 14 films in&lt;/p&gt;

Following the economic, scientific, political, cultural and military might of the United Kingdom from the 18th century, and of the United States since the mid 20th century, it has become the lingua franca in many parts of the world, and the leading language in international business and science. It is used widely as a second language and as an official language in the European Union and many Commonwealth countries, as well as in many world organisations.
Historically, English originated from several dialects, now collectively termed Old English, which were brought to the eastern coast of the island of Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers beginning in the 5th century. English was further influenced by the Old Norse language of Viking invaders.
After the time of the Norman conquest, Old English developed into Middle English, borrowing heavily from the Norman-French vocabulary and spelling conventions. The etymology of the word &quot;English&quot; is a derivation from the 12th century Old English englisc from Engle, &quot;[the] Angles&quot;.
Modern English developed with the Great Vowel&lt;/p&gt;

With an area of 28,000&amp;#160;square kilometres (11,000&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi) it is one of the smallest countries in continental Africa. It is also the most prosperous, however the wealth is concentrated in government and elite hands, with 70% of the population living under the United Nations Poverty Threshold of $2/day. It has a population of 1,014,999. It comprises two parts: a Continental Region (R&amp;#237;o Muni), including several small offshore islands like Corisco, Elobey Grande and Elobey Chico; and an insular region containing Annob&amp;#243;n island and Bioko island (formerly Fernando Po) where the capital Malabo is situated.
Annob&amp;#243;n is the southernmost island of Equatorial Guinea and is situated just south of the equator. Bioko island is the northernmost point of Equatorial Guinea. Between the two islands and to the east is the mainland region.

One of the four main characters along with fellow protagonists Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and Kenny McCormick, he is often portrayed as the series&#39; main antagonist in opposition to his friends, who commonly refer to him by his family name. He debuted on television when South Park first aired on August 13, 1997; he had earlier appeared in The Spirit of Christmas shorts created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone in 1992 (Jesus vs. Frosty) and 1995 (Jesus vs. Santa).
Voiced by Trey Parker, Cartman is an overweight, spoiled, foul-mouthed, mean-spirited, selfish, and ill-tempered fourth-grader living with his single mother in the fictional town of South Park, Colorado, where he commonly has extraordinary experiences not typical of conventional small-town life.
Cartman is one of the most popular characters on the show, and has remained one of the most recognizable television characters ever since South Park became a hit during its first season. Parker and Stone describe the character as &quot;a little Archie Bunker&quot;, and state that he is their favorite character, and the one with whom they most&lt;/p&gt;

It is located to the northeast of Greater London and is one of the most populous counties in England. Essex County Council is the principal local authority for much of the county, sharing functions with twelve district councils. The county town is Chelmsford. The southern Essex boroughs of Thurrock and Southend-on-Sea are governed separately by unitary authorities. It was established in antiquity and formed the eastern portion of the Kingdom of Essex. Sections of the county closer to London are part of the metropolitan green belt, which prohibits development. It is the location of the regionally significant Lakeside Shopping Centre and London Stansted Airport; and the new towns of Basildon and Harlow.
The name Essex originates in the Anglo-Saxon period of the Early Middle Ages and has its root in the Old English &amp;#274;astseaxe (i.e. the &quot;East Saxons&quot;), the eastern kingdom of the Saxons.
In pre-Roman Britain the territories of Suffolk and Essex were home to the Trinovantes tribe, which had grown wealthy through intensive trade with the Roman&lt;/p&gt;

Officially known as the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, it is the second-most populous nation in Africa with over 79.2 million people and the tenth-largest by area with its 1,100,000&amp;#160;km. The capital is Addis Ababa. Ethiopia is bordered by Djibouti and Somalia to the east, Kenya to the south, Sudan to the west, and Eritrea to the north.
Though most African nations are, in their modern form, less than a century old, Ethiopia has been an independent state since ancient times, being one of the oldest countries in the world. A monarchical state for most of its history, the Ethiopian dynasty traces its roots to the 10th century BC. Besides being an ancient country, Ethiopia is one of the oldest sites of human existence known to scientists today, having yielded some of humanity&#39;s oldest traces, it might be the place where Homo sapiens first set out for the Middle East and points beyond. When Africa was divided up by European powers at the Berlin Conference, Ethiopia was one of only two countries that retained its independence. It was one of only four African members of the&lt;/p&gt;

He is known for his work in Canadian television series, American movies and television movies. He is the only actor to have starred in all seven of the American Pie movies: American Pie, American Pie 2, American Wedding, Band Camp, The Naked Mile, Beta House and The Book of Love as Noah Levenstein and also he had an almost major role in Cheaper By The Dozen 2.
Levy was born to a Jewish family in Hamilton, Ontario. His father was a foreman in an automobile plant. He went to Westdale Secondary School, and attended McMaster University. He was vice president of the McMaster Film Board, a student film group where he met moviemaker Ivan Reitman.
An alumnus of both Second City Toronto and the sketch comedy series SCTV, Levy often plays unusual supporting characters with nerdish streaks. Perhaps his best known role on SCTV was as the dimwitted Earl Camembert, a news anchor for the &quot;SCTV News&quot; and a parody of real-life Canadian newsman Earl Cameron.

What is now Evanston was once part of a larger area called &quot;Grosse Pointe Territory&quot; in the 1830s. The first non-native Americans settled in 1836, in an area that by 1850 was called Ridgeville. In 1851, a group of Methodists founded Northwestern University and chose the area as its new home. In 1854, the founders of Northwestern submitted to the county judge their plans for a city to be named Evanston after John Evans, one of their leaders. In 1857, the request was granted.
Evanston was formally incorporated as a town on December 29, 1863, but declined in 1869 to become a city despite the Illinois legislature passing a bill for that purpose. Evanston expanded after the Civil War with the annexation of the village of North Evanston. Finally, in early 1892, following the annexation of the&lt;/p&gt;

As of the 2000 census, the town had a total population of 57,340. In July 2006, Money Magazine ranked Fairfield the ninth &quot;best place to live&quot; in the United States, and the best place to live in the Northeast. This is primarily due to its affluence, low crime rate with only three homicides in the last five years  , excellent public school system, suburban character, scenic location on the Long Island Sound, and proximity to New York City. The town was also listed among the &quot;preppiest&quot; places in the United States in the tongue-in-cheek 1980s best-seller The Official Preppy Handbook.
It considers itself the &quot;dogwood capital of the world,&quot; and each spring a Dogwood Festival takes place in the Greenfield Hill neighborhood.

Fort Collins is located 57&amp;#160;miles (92&amp;#160;km) north of the Colorado State Capitol in Denver. With an estimated 2008 population of 136,509, it is the fifth most populous city in Colorado. Fort Collins is a large college town, home to Colorado State University. It was named Money magazine&#39;s Best Place to Live 2006 and #2 in 2008.
Fort Collins was founded as a military outpost of the United States Army in 1864. It succeeded a previous encampment, known as Camp Collins, on the Cache La Poudre River, near present-day Laporte. Camp Collins was erected during the Indian wars of the mid-1860s to protect the Overland mail route that had been recently relocated through the region. Travelers crossing the county on the Overland Trail would camp there, but a flood destroyed the camp in June 1864. Afterward, the commander of the fort wrote to the commandant of Fort Laramie in southeast Wyoming, Colonel William O. Collins, suggesting that a site several miles further down the Poudre would make a good&lt;/p&gt;

Around 190 million people speak French as a second language, and an additional 200 million speak it as an acquired foreign language. French speaking communities are present in 57 countries and territories. Most native speakers of the language live in France, where the language originated. The rest live essentially in Canada, particularly Quebec, New Brunswick and Ontario, as well as Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and certain places in the U.S. states of Maine and Louisiana. Most second-language speakers of French live in Francophone Africa, arguably exceeding the number of native speakers.
French is a descendant of the Latin language of the Roman Empire, as are national languages such as Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Romanian, and minority languages ranging from Occitan to Neapolitan and many more. Its closest relatives however are the other langues d&#39;o&amp;#239;l and French-based creole languages. Its development was also influenced by the native Celtic languages of Roman Gaul and by the (Germanic) Frankish language of the post-Roman Frankish&lt;/p&gt;

It has a population of 4,492 (2002 Census), making it the most populated atoll in the country. It is a narrow sweep of land between 20 and 400 metres wide, encircling a large lagoon 18 km long and 14 km wide, with 275 sq km&amp;#8212;by far the largest lagoon in Tuvalu. The land area of the 33 islets aggregates to 2.4 sq km, less than one percent of the total area of the atoll. There is an airstrip, hotel (Vaiaku Langi Hotel), and administrative buildings, as well as homes, constructed both in the traditional manner, out of palm fronds, and more recently out of cement blocks. The most prominent building on Funafuti atoll is the Church of Tuvalu. Other sites of interest are the remains of United States aircraft that crashed on Funafuti during World War II, when the airstrip was used by the U.S. forces to defend the Gilbert Islands and the Marshall Islands. The U.S. claimed Funafuti under the Guano Islands Act from the 1800s until a treaty of friendship was concluded in 1979, coming into effect in 1983.
The largest island is Fongafale. On this island, there are four villages, of which one is Vaiaku, where the Tuvalu&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;

It covers a land area of nearly 270,000&amp;#160;km&amp;#178; and has an estimated population of 1,500,000. Its capital and largest city is Libreville.
Since its independence from France on August 17, 1960, Gabon has been ruled by three presidents. In the early 1990s, Gabon introduced a multi-party system and a new democratic constitution that allowed for a more transparent electoral process and reformed many governmental institutions. The small population density together with abundant natural resources and foreign private investment have helped make Gabon one of the most prosperous countries in the region, with the highest HDI in Sub-Saharan Africa.
The earliest inhabitants of the area were Pygmy peoples. They were largely replaced and absorbed by Bantu tribes as they migrated.
In the 15th century, the first Europeans arrived. The nation&#39;s present name originates from &quot;Gab&amp;#227;o&quot;, Portuguese for &quot;cloak&quot;, which is roughly the&lt;/p&gt;

It is the administrative capital of the South-East District as well as the sub-district of Gaborone. Locals often refer to the city as Gabs.
Gaborone is situated at 24&amp;#176;39&amp;#8242;29&amp;#8243;S 25&amp;#176;54&amp;#8242;44&amp;#8243;E&amp;#65279; / &amp;#65279;24.65806&amp;#176;S 25.91222&amp;#176;E&amp;#65279; / -24.65806; 25.91222 between Kgale and Oodi Hills, on the Notwane River in the southeastern corner of Botswana, and 15&amp;#160;kilometres (9.3&amp;#160;mi) from the South African border. The city is served by the Sir Seretse Khama International Airport.
Evidence shows that there have been inhabitants along the Notwane River for centuries. In more recent history, Chief Kgosi Gaborone left the Magaliesberg to settle in the area around 1880, and called the settlement Moshaweng. The city was then called Gaberones by the early European settlers. Gaberones, derived from Gaborone&#39;s Village, was named after Chief Gaborone of the BaTlokwa, whose home village, now called Tlokweng, was across the river from the Government Camp, the name of the colonial government headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

Before Star Trek: The Next Generation, McFadden often worked for Jim Henson productions, including the films The Dark Crystal (as choreographer), Labyrinth (as Director of Choreography and Puppet Movement), and The Muppets Take Manhattan (choreographer and a brief on-screen appearance).

A major exponent of 20th century filmed dance, Kelly was known for his energetic and athletic dancing style, his good looks and the likeable characters that he played on screen.
Although he is known today for his performance in Singin&#39; in the Rain, he was a dominant force in Hollywood musical films from the mid 1940s until this art form fell out of fashion in the late 1950s. His many innovations transformed the Hollywood musical film, and he is credited with almost single-handedly making the ballet form commercially acceptable to film audiences.
Kelly was the recipient of an Academy Honorary Award in 1952 for his career achievements. He later received lifetime achievement awards in the Kennedy Center Honors, and from the Screen Actors Guild and American Film Institute; in 1999, the American Film Institute also numbered him 15th in their Greatest Male Stars of All Time list.

Gene Coon served in the United States Marine Corps for four years during and after World War II, seeing combat in the Pacific theater and serving in China and in occupied Japan.
Gene Coon wrote mainly for television. His writing credits included Dragnet, Bonanza, Zorro, Wagon Train, and The Wild Wild West, as well as the premiere episode of McHale&#39;s Navy. He also became a producer for The Wild Wild West and later became a producer and writer for Star Trek. His Wagon Train scripts contained strong moral lessons opposing war and of personal redemption, and he later repeated very similar themes in his Star Trek scripts, which earned the latter series an unofficial nickname of &quot;Wagon Train in Space&quot;. &quot;He joined Star Trek in the middle of the first season, and left in the middle of the second season. He continued to contribute scripts for the third season, under the pseudonym &quot;Lee Cronin&quot;, as he was under contract to Universal Studios at the time and was not, technically, supposed to be working for Paramount as well.

Today George Raft is mostly known for his role in Billy Wilder&#39;s 1959 comedy Some Like it Hot and also Scarface (1932), Bolero (1934), and They Drive by Night (1940).
Raft was born George Ranft in Hell&#39;s Kitchen, New York City to German immigrant Conrad Ranft and his wife Eva Glockner. A boyhood friend of gangster Owney Madden, he admittedly narrowly avoided a life of crime.
As a young man he showed aptitude in dancing, and with his elegant fashion sense, this enabled him to gain employment as a dancer in New York City nightclubs. He became part of the stage act of Texas Guinan and his success led him to Broadway where he again worked as a dancer. He worked in London as a chorus boy in the early 1920s.
Vi Kearney, later a dancer in shows for Charles Cochran and Andre Charlot, was quoted as saying:
In 1929, Raft relocated to Hollywood and took small roles. His success came in Scarface (1932), and Raft&#39;s convincing portrayal led to speculation that Raft was a gangster. Due to his life-long friendship with Owney Madden, Raft was a friend&lt;/p&gt;

The inner city of George Town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
George Town was founded in 1786 by Captain Francis Light, a trader for the British East India Company, as base for the company in the Malay States. He obtained the island of Penang from the Sultan of Kedah and built Fort Cornwallis on the north-eastern corner of the island. The fort became the nexus of a growing trading post and the island&#39;s population reached 12,000 by 1804.
The town was built on swampy land that had to be cleared of vegetation, levelled and filled. The original commercial town was laid out between Light Street, Beach Street (then running&lt;/p&gt;

It is one of the world&#39;s major languages and by far the most widely spoken first language in the European Union. Globally, German is spoken by approximately 120 million native speakers and also by about 80 million non-native speakers. Standard German is widely taught in schools, universities and Goethe Institutes worldwide.
German is spoken primarily in Germany (where it is the first language for more than 95% of the population), Austria (89%) and Switzerland (65%). German is also spoken by the majority of the populations of Luxembourg and Liechtenstein.
Other European German-speaking communities are found in Northern Italy (in the Province of Bolzano-Bozen and in some municipalities in other provinces), in the East Cantons of Belgium, in the French Alsace region which often was traded between Germany and France in history and in some border villages of the former South Jutland County (in German, Nordschleswig, in Danish, S&amp;#248;nderjylland) of Denmark.
German-speaking communities can still be found in parts of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania,&lt;/p&gt;

A region named Germania, inhabited by several Germanic peoples, has been known and documented before AD 100. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire, which lasted until 1806. During the 16th century, northern Germany became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. As a modern nation-state, the country was first unified amidst the Franco-Prussian War in 1871. In 1949, after World War II,&lt;/p&gt;

The word Ghana means &quot;Warrior King&quot; and derives from the Ghana Empire.
Ghana was inhabited in pre-colonial times by a number of ancient predominantly Akan Kingdoms, including the Akwamu on the eastern coast, the inland Ashanti Empire and various Fante and non-Akan states, like the Ga and Ewe, along the coast and inland. Trade with European states flourished after contact with the Portuguese in the 15th century, and the British established a Crown colony, Gold Coast, in 1874.
The Gold Coast achieved independence from the United Kingdom in 1957, becoming the first sub-Saharan African nation to do so and the name Ghana was chosen for the new nation to reflect the ancient Empire of Ghana, which once extended throughout much of west Africa. Ghana is a member of many international organizations including the Commonwealth of Nations, the Economic Community of West African States, the African Union, La Francophonie (Associate Member) and the United Nations.

The territory itself is a peninsula of 6.843&amp;#160;square kilometres (2.642&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi) whose isthmus connects to the north with Spain. The Rock of Gibraltar is the major landmark of the area and gives its name to the densely populated town, home to almost 30,000 Gibraltarians.
Gibraltar was captured by a joint Anglo-Dutch force in 1704 during the War of Spanish Succession and subsequently ceded to Britain by Spain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The sovereignty of Gibraltar is a major point of contention in Anglo-Spanish relations as Spain asserts a claim to the territory and seeks its return. Gibraltarians resoundingly rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty in referendums held in 1967 and 2002.
Gibraltar was for almost three centuries an important strategic base for the Royal Navy, which drove the local economy and provided employment for a large proportion of the local population. Nowadays, the economy is largely based on tourism, financial services and shipping.
The name Gibraltar is&lt;/p&gt;

Stark was a regular supporting player on TV - notably with his good friend Peter Sellers in A Show Called Fred and Son of Fred, and with Benny Hill - before getting his own sketch series. All the editions were scripted by Johnny Speight and each one featured a different group of supporting actors, including Deryck Guyler, Arthur Mullard, Derek Nimmo, Patricia Hayes and Warren Mitchell. Stark worked and socialised quite a bit with Spike Milligan and Sellers, and is mentioned throughout biographies of them, such as Pauline Scudamore&#39;s (1985) biography of Milligan, and especially in Roger Lewis&#39; comprehensive (1995) biography of Sellers.
He appeared in the Pink Panther film series. Other than Herbert Lom and Burt Kwouk, he has appeared in more Pink Panther films than any other person. For the most part Stark plays a different character in each Pink Panther film. He first appears as Hercule&lt;/p&gt;

A younger version of the character makes a brief cameo in the prequel film Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, where he was portrayed by Wayne Pygram. He was also portrayed by Keene Curtis in the Star Wars radio drama. Tarkin has been called &quot;one of the most formidable villains in Star Wars history&quot;.
In A New Hope, Tarkin is the Governor of the Imperial Outland Regions and commander of the Death Star. He is charged, along with Darth Vader, with pursuing and destroying the Rebel Alliance. He threatens Princess Leia Organa with the destruction of her home planet of Alderaan if she does not reveal the location of the Rebels&#39; base. When she names another planet, he destroys Alderaan anyway; seemingly of his own initiative without any authorization from the Emperor. Tarkin dies when Luke Skywalker destroys the Death Star in the film&#39;s climax.

It is located on the Hampshire / Surrey border 2.4 miles (3.9&amp;#160;km) northwest of Haslemere, approximately one hour by road from central London.
The nearest railway station is 2.1 miles (3.4&amp;#160;km) southeast of the village, at Haslemere.
The village is a collection of houses on either side of a road called Headley Road, which leads from the A3 to Headley Down, and Bordon. Just east of the village centre, splitting the village in two, is Boundary Road, which marks the boundary between Hampshire and Surrey. Grayshott was counted as part of Headley parish until 1901 (ecclesiastical parish) and 1902 (civil parish). It is now the basis of Grayshott civil parish, which is part of East Hampshire District.
Facilities in the village include St. Luke&#39;s Church, which is a part of the Guildford diocese, and Grayshott Primary School; both of these trace their origins to the 19th century. The village also has a village hall, a fire station, and a village square. Two village greens are close to the centre. There is also a recreation ground with cricket pavilion, football club and skate park, and good woodlands&lt;/p&gt;

A large majority of the district is home to upper middle class families. Greenwich Village, however, was known in the late 19th to mid 20th centuries as the bohemian capital and the East Coast birthplace of the Beat movement. What provided the initial attractive character of the community eventually contributed to its gentrification and commercialization.
The name of the village is Anglicized from the Dutch name Groenwijck, meaning &quot;Pine District&quot;, into its near heterograph Greenwich, a borough of London, England.
The neighborhood is bounded by Broadway on the east, the Hudson River on the west, Houston Street on the south, and 14th Street on the north. The neighborhoods surrounding it are the East Village to the east, SoHo and Hudson Square to the south, and Chelsea to the north.

Grenada is located northwest of Trinidad and Tobago, northeast of Venezuela, and southwest of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.
Its size is 344&amp;#160;km&amp;#178;, with an estimated population of	110,000. Its capital is St. George&#39;s. The national bird of Grenada is the critically endangered Grenada Dove.
The recorded history of Grenada begins in 1498. At the time the indigenous Island Caribs (Kalinago) who lived there called it Camahogne. The Spaniards did not permanently settle on Camahogne. Later the English failed their first settlement attempts, but the French fought and conquered Grenada from the Caribs circa 1650. The French conquest resulted in the genocide of 17th century Caribs from present-day Grenada. Warfare also existed between the Caribs of present day Dominica and St. Vincent and the Grenadines with the French invaders.
The French took control of Camahogne and named the new French colony La Grenade. La Grenade prospered as a wealthy French colony; its main export was sugar. The&lt;/p&gt;

It is the best harbour on the island, consisting of a bay (King Edward Cove) within a bay (Cumberland East Bay). The site is quite sheltered, provides a substantial area of flat land suitable for building on, and has a good supply of fresh water.
The settlement at Grytviken was established on November 16, 1904, by the Norwegian sea captain Carl Anton Larsen as a whaling station for his Compa&amp;#241;&amp;#237;a Argentina de Pesca (Argentine Fishing Company). It was phenomenally successful, with 195 whales taken in the first season alone. The whalers used every part of the animals - the blubber, meat, bones and viscera were cooked to extract the oil and the bones and meat were turned into fertilizer and fodder. Elephant seals were also hunted for their blubber. Around 300 men worked at the station during its heyday, operating during the southern summer from October to March. A few remained over the winter to maintain the boats and factory. Every few months a&lt;/p&gt;

The city is located at 14&amp;#176;38&amp;#8242;N 90&amp;#176;33&amp;#8242;W&amp;#65279; / &amp;#65279;14.633&amp;#176;N 90.55&amp;#176;W&amp;#65279; / 14.633; -90.55, in a mountain valley called Valle de la Ermita in the south central part of the country.
Within the confines of modern Guatemala City is the ancient Maya city of Kaminaljuyu. Kaminaljuyu dates back some 900 years and is one of America&#39;s most notable archaeological sites. The center of Kaminaljuyu was located a short distance from the oldest part of Guatemala City. However, in the late 20th century, the city grew around the ruins, and, in some cases, over some of the outlying ruins before they were protected.
Many of the several hundred temple mounds have been built over with freeways, shopping centers, commerce, luxury hotels and residential areas. The central ceremonial center of Kaminaljuyu was however protected by the Guatemalan government and is now a park within the city. There are also many ruins still in existence,&lt;/p&gt;

As well as the island of Guernsey itself, it also includes Alderney, Herm, Jethou, Brecqhou, Burhou, Lihou, Sark and other islets. Although the defence of all these islands is the responsibility of the United Kingdom, the Bailiwick of Guernsey is not part of the U.K. but rather a separate possession of the Crown, comparable to the Isle of Man. Guernsey is also not part of the European Union. The island of Guernsey is divided into 10 parishes. Together with the Bailiwick of Jersey, the Bailiwick of Guernsey is included in the collective grouping known as the Channel Islands. Guernsey belongs to the Common Travel Area.
Rising sea levels transformed Guernsey first into the tip of a peninsula jutting out into the emergent English Channel, then, around 6000 BC, into an island when it and other promontories were cut off from continental Europe.
At this time, Neolithic farmers settled the coasts and created the dolmens and menhirs that dot the islands. The island of Guernsey contains three&lt;/p&gt;

Formerly known as French Guinea (Guin&amp;#233;e fran&amp;#231;aise), it is today sometimes called Guinea-Conakry to distinguish it from its neighbor Guinea-Bissau. Conakry is the capital, the seat of the national government, and the largest city.
Guinea has almost 246,000&amp;#160;square kilometres (94,981&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi). It forms a crescent by curving from its western border on the Atlantic Ocean toward the east and the south. Guinea shares its northern border with Guinea-Bissau, Senegal, and Mali. Guinea shares its southern border with Sierra Leone, Liberia, and C&amp;#244;te d&#39;Ivoire. The Niger River arises in Guinea and runs eastward.
Guinea is home to twenty-four ethnic groups. The most prominent groups are the Fula, Mandinka, and Susu.
Guinea belonged to a series of empires until France colonized it in the 1890s, and made it part of French West Africa. Guinea declared its independence from France on 2 October 1958. Since its independence, Guinea has had autocratic rulers who have made Guinea one of the poorest countries.

Ritchie was born in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, the second of two children born to Amber (n&amp;#233;e Parkinson) and John Vivian Ritchie, an advertising executive. Ritchie, who is dyslexic, was expelled from Stanbridge Earls School, one of the most prominent institutions specialising in dyslexia in the UK, at the age of 15. He has stated that drug use was the reason for the expulsion; his father, however, has said that it was because his son was caught &quot;cutting class and entertaining a girl in his room.&quot; He also attended Sibford School.
In addition to his elder sister, Tabitha, a dance instructor, Ritchie has a half-brother, Kevin Bayton, who was born to Amber Parkinson when she was a teenager and given up for adoption. From 1973 until 1980, when they divorced, Ritchie&#39;s mother was married to Sir Michael Leighton, 11th baronet. As a divorc&amp;#233;e, she is correctly styled as Amber, Lady Leighton.
Ritchie directed a 20-minute short film in 1995 entitled The Hard Case. His first full-length feature was the successful Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels in 1998. He was introduced to Madonna when the soundtrack to&lt;/p&gt;

Discovered by Europeans in 1498, Guyana has been struggled over for 500 years by the Spanish, French, Dutch, and British. It is the only state of the Commonwealth of Nations on mainland South America. Guyana is also a member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), which has its secretariat headquarters in Guyana&#39;s capital, Georgetown. Guyana achieved independence from the United Kingdom in 26 May 1966.
Historically, the region known as &quot;Guiana or Guayana&quot; was the large shield landmass north of the Amazon River and East of the Orinoco River. Five sub-regions were carved out of the landmass by colonial powers in the late 17th and early 18th century: Spanish Guiana (now eastern Venezuela), Portuguese Guiana (now northern Brazil), British Guiana (Guyana), Dutch Guiana (Suriname), and the present French overseas department of French Guiana. Modern Guyana is bordered to the east by Suriname, to the south and southwest by Brazil, to the west by Venezuela, and on the north&lt;/p&gt;

Haiti&#39;s regional, historical, and ethnolinguistic position is unique for several reasons. It was the first independent nation in Latin America and the first black-led republic in the world when it gained independence as part of a successful slave rebellion in 1804.

Needham was born in Memphis, Tennessee, the son of Edith May (n&amp;#233;e Robinson) and Howard Needham. He was raised in Arkansas and Missouri. Needham was a paratrooper during the Korean War, worked as a treetopper, and was a billboard model for Viceroy Cigarettes while beginning a career in Hollywood as a motion picture stuntman.
Needham&#39;s first break was as the stunt double for actor Richard Boone on the popular TV western Have Gun, Will Travel. Needham trained under John Wayne&#39;s stunt double Chuck Roberson and quickly became one of the top stuntman of the 1960s on such films as How the West Was Won, McLintock, The War Lord, and Little Big Man. He doubled regularly for Clint Walker and Burt Reynolds. Needham moved into stunt coordinating and directing second unit action, while designing and introducing air bags and other innovative equipment to the industry.
In 1971, he and fellow stuntmen Glenn Wilder, and Ronnie Rondell, created Stunts Unlimited. Needham had written a screenplay titled Smokey and the Bandit and his friend Reynolds offered him the chance to direct. The film was a huge hit, and the two&lt;/p&gt;

Hamilton is located on the north side of Hamilton Harbour, and is Bermuda&#39;s main port. Although there is a parish of the same name, the city of Hamilton is in the parish of Pembroke. The City is named after Sir Henry Hamilton, governor from 1778 to 1794. The parish of Hamilton pre-dates it.
In spite of being the administrative capital of Bermuda, Hamilton only has a permanent population of approximately 969, although some estimates have it as high as 1,500. Hamilton is the only incorporated city in Bermuda, but actually is smaller than the historic town of St. George&#39;s. A more representative measure of Bermuda population tends to be by parish.
As the offshore domicile of many foreign companies, Bermuda has a highly-developed international business economy; it is a financial exporter of financial services, primarily insurance, reinsurance, investment funds and special purpose vehicles (SPV). Finance and international business now constitute the largest sector of Bermuda&#39;s economy, and virtually all of this business takes place within&lt;/p&gt;

Conceived by George Hamilton when he purchased the Durand farm shortly after the War of 1812, Hamilton has become the centre of a densely populated and industrialized region at the west end of Lake Ontario known as the Golden Horseshoe. On January 1, 2001, the new City of Hamilton was formed through the amalgamation of the former city and the other constituent lower-tier municipalities of the Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth with the upper-tier regional government. Residents of the city are known as Hamiltonians. Since 1981, the metropolitan area has been listed as the ninth largest in Canada and the third largest in Ontario.
Traditionally, the local economy has been led by the steel and heavy manufacturing industries. Within the last decade, there has been a shift towards the service sector, particularly health sciences. The Hamilton Health Sciences corporation employs nearly 10,000 staff and serves approximately 2.2 million people in the region.

One of west London&#39;s key transport hubs and commercial and employment centres, and home to several multinational company offices, it is focused on the two London Underground stations, bus station and road network node at Hammersmith Broadway. The area is identified in the London Plan as one of 35 major centres in Greater London.
It is bordered by Shepherds Bush to the north, West Kensington to the east, Fulham to the south and Chiswick to the west, and is linked by Hammersmith Bridge to Barnes in the southwest.
It has for some decades been the main centre of London&#39;s Polish minority in United Kingdom.
There is evidence of occupation of some riverside areas around Hammersmith as far back as Roman and Saxon times, and the area was referred to in the Domesday Book. The name may possibly be a shortening of &quot;Hamoder&#39;s Hythe&quot;, i.e. the landing-place of a man named Hamoder.
Consequently, house construction and industrial development flourished. Major industrial sites included the Osram lamp factory at Brook&lt;/p&gt;

Introduced in the film Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (1977), Solo and his Wookiee first mate, Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), become involved in the Rebel Alliance against the authoritarian Galactic Empire. Over the course of the Star Wars franchise, Solo becomes a chief figure in the Alliance and succeeding galactic governments. Star Wars creator George Lucas described Solo as &quot;a loner who realizes the importance of being part of a group and helping for the common good.&quot; The American Film Institute ranked Solo as the 14th greatest film hero. Solo was also deemed the 4th greatest movie character of all-time by Empire magazine.
At the beginning of A New Hope, Solo and Chewbacca are desperate to pay off a debt to Jabba the Hutt. Solo accepts a charter to transport Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness), Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) to Alderaan in Han&#39;s ship, the Millennium Falcon; when they arrive, they find Alderaan has been destroyed by the Death Star, and the Falcon is captured.

Dartmouth College and the US Army Corps of Engineers Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) are located in town. Hanover is one of only a handful of communities where the Appalachian Trail passes through the town center.
Hanover was chartered by Governor Benning Wentworth on July 4, 1761, and in 1765-1766 its first inhabitants arrived, the majority from Connecticut. Although the surface is uneven, the town developed into an agricultural community. Dartmouth College was established in 1769 beside the Common at a village called the Plain -- an extensive and level tract of land a mile (1.61 kilometers) from the Connecticut River, and about 150 feet (45.72 meters) above it. 
At one point in its history, the southwest corner of Hanover was known as Dresden, which in the 1780s joined other disgruntled New Hampshire towns along the Connecticut River that briefly defected to what was then the independent Republic of Vermont. For a time, Dresden&lt;/p&gt;

Its MP is Grant Shapps (Con.). It is known as the town where the first production-line jet airliner, the de Havilland Comet was built and as the site of a tragic rail crash in 2000.
Dating back to Saxon times, the town of Hatfield was first known as &quot;Hetfelle&quot; and then became known as Haethfeld, when around the year 970, King Edgar gave 5,000&amp;#160;acres (20&amp;#160;km) to the monastery of Ely. No other records remain from that time until 1226, when Henry III granted the Bishops of Ely rights to an annual four-day fair and a weekly market. Old Hatfield retains many historic buildings, notably the Old Palace, St Etheldreda&#39;s Church and Hatfield House. The Old Palace was built by the Bishop of Ely, Cardinal Morton, in 1497, during the reign of Henry VII, and the only surviving wing is still used today for Elizabethan-style banquets.

The city is one of the 14 Cuban provinces. The city/province has 2.1 million inhabitants, the largest city in Cuba and the second largest in the Caribbean region.

The sluggish Almendares River traverses the city from south to north, entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay. In 1959 the city halted its growth, and since then has suffered a net loss of living units, despite its population increase.
King Philip II of Spain granted Havana the title of City in 1592 and a royal decree in 1634 recognized its importance by officially designating it the &quot;Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies&quot;.

He is also a co-founder of Studio Ghibli, an animation studio and production company.
He remained largely unknown to the West, until Miramax released his 1997 Princess Mononoke. By that time, his films had already enjoyed both commercial and critical success in Japan. Princess Mononoke was the highest-grossing film in Japan until Titanic (1997) came out a few months later, and the first animated film to win Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards. His later film, Spirited Away, had that distinction as well, and was the first anime film to win an Academy Award, topping Titanic in the Japanese box office. Howl&#39;s Moving Castle was also nominated, but did not receive the award.
Miyazaki&#39;s films often incorporate recurrent themes, such as humanity&#39;s relationship to nature and technology, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic. Reflecting Miyazaki&#39;s feminism, the protagonists of his films are often strong, independent girls or young women; with the exceptions of The Castle of Cagliostro and Castle in the Sky, his films often depict&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Henry Jaynes Fonda (May 16, 1905 &amp;#8211; August 12, 1982) was an American film and stage actor, best known for his roles as plain-speaking idealists.
Fonda made his mark early as a Broadway actor. He also appeared in 1938 in plays performed in White Plains, New York, with Joan Tompkins. He made his Hollywood debut in 1935, and his career gained momentum after his Academy Award-nominated performance as Tom Joad in The Grapes of Wrath, a 1940 adaptation of John Steinbeck&#39;s novel about an Oklahoma family who moved west during the Dust Bowl. Throughout six decades in Hollywood, Fonda cultivated a strong, appealing screen image in such classics as The Ox-Bow Incident, Mister Roberts and 12 Angry Men. Later, Fonda moved toward both more challenging, darker epics as Sergio Leone&#39;s Once Upon a Time in the West (portraying a villain who kills, among others, a child) and lighter roles in family comedies like Yours, Mine and Ours with Lucille Ball.
Fonda was the patriarch of a family of famous actors, including daughter Jane Fonda, son Peter Fonda, granddaughter Bridget Fonda, and grandson Troy Garity; his family and close friends called him &quot;Hank&quot;. In 1999, he was named the sixth Greatest Male&lt;/p&gt;

First portrayed by George Takei in the original Star Trek series, Sulu also appears in the animated Star Trek series, the first six Star Trek movies, one episode of Star Trek: Voyager, and in numerous books, comics, and video games. John Cho assumed the role of the character in the 2009 film Star Trek.
George Takei recalled Gene Roddenberry wanted the character to represent all of Asia, which symbolized the peace of the Trek universe in spite of the numerous wars in the continent. Roddenberry did not want a nationally specific surname, so he looked at a map and saw the Sulu Sea. &quot;He thought, &#39;Ah, the waters of that sea touch all shores&#39;,&quot; the actor recalled, &quot;and that&#39;s how my character came to have the name Sulu.&quot; In the book Inside Star Trek The Real Story, the character&#39;s name is noted as a pun on the name of vice president of Desilu Studios, Herb Solow.
Novelist Vonda McIntyre first presents &#39;Hikaru&#39; as the character&#39;s first name in the novel The Entropy Effect. However, the name did not become canon until its mention in Star Trek VI, and it was included only after Peter David, who authored the film&#39;s comic book&lt;/p&gt;

Originally aiming to be an action star, Sanada began training with actor and martial arts star Sonny Chiba&#39;s Japan Action Club where he developed good all-round martial arts ability. Sanada&#39;s martial arts film career led him in contact with Michelle Yeoh, who he later starred with in Danny Boyle&#39;s Sunshine. He also has a long-standing friendship with Jackie Chan, although he didn&#39;t star in a film with him before Rush Hour 3 in 2007.
Sanada has often been credited, in his younger days, as either Henry, Harry or Duke Sanada.
Sanada has established himself as a character actor who adept at a variety of roles. Sanada was first noticed as a serious actor in the movie Mahjong Hourouki directed by Makoto Wada. Wada and Sanada&#39;s relationship may be similar to that of John Huston and Humphrey Bogart. Since Mahjong Hourouki, Sanada has acted in every one of Wada&#39;s movies, works filled with humor and a nostalgic attachment for classic movies.
In 1999 and 2000, he performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company in their production of King Lear. This&lt;/p&gt;

Played by Alan Tudyk, Wash serves as the pilot of Serenity, a transport ship captained by Malcolm Reynolds. He is married to the ship&#39;s first mate, Zoe. 

Raised on an unnamed planet with pollution so thick the stars were not visible, Wash became a pilot in part to see the sky beyond his home. According to the Serenity novelization (which is not considered canon), Wash was second in his class. Mr. Universe, Wash&#39;s friend in flight school, was top of the class, since he hacked the records. In order to buy Wash&#39;s silence (and save himself from a threat of bodily injury at the hands of Wash), Mr. Universe offered Wash his services whenever they were needed. 

On the commentary on War Stories, Tudyk says that he believed Wash served in the Unification War. According to him, Wash served as a pilot during the war, although he did not specify which side. However, Tudyk believes his ship was shot down after a single&lt;/p&gt;

In 1886, a group of Barton County businessmen formed the Central Kansas Town Company and founded the town of Hoisington to attract the Kansas and Colorado Railroad to the area. They named the settlement after Andrew J. Hoisington, one of the company partners and a prominent businessman in nearby Great Bend. The railroad reached Hoisington in the fall of 1886, and the settlement was incorporated as a city in 1887. The post office, relocated from nearby Buena Vista, was renamed Hoisington in April 1887 as was the train station, originally named Monon, by 1889.
Hoisington modernized and grew steadily over the following decades. The city&#39;s first power plant opened in 1903, and a city water system was completed in 1904. The railroad, known by that point as the Missouri Pacific, continued to play a central role in the city&#39;s development, employing 1,600 local men by 1911. Hoisington became a major freight and passenger operating division, complete with a roundhouse and shops. Electric street lights were installed in 1915, and the first streets were paved in 1917.

The Tsugaru Strait separates Hokkaid&amp;#333; from Honsh&amp;#363;, although the two islands are connected by the underwater Seikan Tunnel.

Archeologists theorize that Hokkaid&amp;#333; was settled by Ainu, Gilyak, and Oroke 20,000 years ago. The Nihon Shoki, finished in 720, is often said to be the first mention of Hokkaid&amp;#333; in recorded history. According to the text, Abe no Hirafu led a large navy and army to northern areas from 658 to 660 and came into contact with the Mishihase and Emishi.

Today it is considered a village in its own right even though it looks to the casual observer like a far corner of High Wycombe. It is next to Hazlemere, about three miles (5 km) south of Great Missenden but unlike Hazlemere, Holmer Green is part of both Little Missenden parish and Chiltern District &amp;#8211; a reflection of its origins which lie in Little Missenden.
Holmer Green is named after the manor of Holmer that covered a significant part of the parish of Little Missenden in the medieval period. The early history of the village is essentially one of people moving out of Little Missenden over the centuries and settling on a large area of heath (now vanished) known as Wycombe Heath or Holmer Heath. The &#39;Holmer&#39; part of the name was first recorded as Holeme in 1208 and is probably Anglo Saxon in origin. It is commonly thought to derive from &#39;mere in a hollow&#39; which would refer to Holmer Pond.

Its character changed during the Middle Ages and the Early Modern period, when the power of the emperor gradually weakened in favour of the princes. In its last centuries its character became quite close to a union of territories. The first emperor of the realm, which was later called Holy Roman Empire, who was not member of the Carolingian dynasty, was Otto I, crowned in 962. The last was Francis II, who abdicated and dissolved the Empire in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars. In a decree following the 1512 Diet of Cologne, the name was officially changed to Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation (German: Heiliges R&amp;#246;misches Reich Deutscher Nation, Latin: Imperium Romanum Sacrum Nationis Germanic&amp;#230;) .
The Empire&#39;s territorial extent varied over its history, but at its peak it encompassed the Kingdom of Germany, the Kingdom of Italy and the Kingdom of Burgundy; for much of its history the Empire consisted of hundreds of smaller sub-units, principalities, duchies,&lt;/p&gt;

It was formerly known as Spanish Honduras to differentiate it from British Honduras (now Belize). The country is bordered to the west by Guatemala, to the southwest by El Salvador, to the southeast by Nicaragua, to the south by the Pacific Ocean at the Gulf of Fonseca, and to the north by the Gulf of Honduras, a large inlet of the Caribbean Sea.
Its size is just over 112,000&amp;#160;km&amp;#178; with an estimated population of almost eight million. Its capital is Tegucigalpa.
The Spanish had different terms to refer to the area that became the Central American country of Honduras.

It wasn&#39;t until the end of the sixteenth century that Honduras was used for the whole province.

The name &quot;Honiara&quot; is actually a misnomer: the English colonialists found it hard to pronounce the original name of the area in the northern Guadalcanal languages: Nagoniara. Nagoniara means &quot;in front of the wind.&quot;
Honiara is located on the northern coast of the island of Guadalcanal and includes a sea port at Point Cruz. The town revolves around the Kukum Highway, which connects Henderson Field in the east of Honiara with the settlement of White River in the west, and passes the National Referral Hospital and the recently burnt down Chinatown. Honiara is located at 9&amp;#176;28&#39; South, 159&amp;#176;49&#39; East (-9.46667, 159.81667).
The climate is tropical, the average daytime temperature is about 28 degrees Celsius, the water temperatures between 26 and 29 degrees. Damper periods are predominantly between November and April. The average amount of precipitation per year is about 2,000&amp;#160;mm and thus somewhat lower than the average on the entire Solomon Islands (3,000&amp;#160;mm).

Although Honolulu refers to the urban area on the southeastern shore of the island of Oahu, the city and the county are consolidated, known as the City and County of Honolulu, and the city and county is designated as the entire island. The City and County of Honolulu is the only incorporated city in Hawaii, as all other local government entities are administered at the county level. The population of the CDP was 371,657 at the 2000 census, while the population of the City and County was 909,863. In the Hawaiian language, Honolulu means &quot;sheltered bay&quot; or &quot;place of shelter.&quot;
Evidence of the first settlement of Honolulu by the original Polynesian migrants to the archipelago comes from oral histories and artifacts. These indicate that there was a settlement where Honolulu now stands in the 12th century. However, after Kamehameha I conquered O&amp;#699;ahu in the Battle of Nu&amp;#699;uanu at Nu&amp;#699;uanu Pali, he moved his royal court from the Island of Hawai&amp;#699;i to Waik&amp;#299;k&amp;#299; in 1804.

The City of Hornell is located within the Town of Hornellsville. Hornell is about 55 miles south of Rochester and is near the western edge of Steuben County.
Hornell is nicknamed &quot;Maple City&quot; after the large maple trees on Main and Broadway streets and being nestled in the Canisteo valley surrounded by beautiful forest. Hornell has the largest St. Patrick&#39;s Day parade and celebration in the area, bringing many out to welcome spring and show their green. It has also become a tradition that Mayor Shawn Hogan finds an innovative way of making his way down main street on this particular day.
Hornell Municipal Airport (4G6) is located a few miles north of the city on Route 36. The airport has a hard surface runway capable of landing small jets, a rotating beacon and fuel.
What is now Hornell was settled in 1790 under the name &quot;Upper Canisteo&quot; to distinguish it from the community of Canisteo. The area was incorporated as a town in 1820, as&lt;/p&gt;

Hot Springs is traditionally best known for the natural spring water that gives it its name, flowing out of the ground at a temperature of 147 degrees Fahrenheit (64 degrees C). Hot Springs National Park is the oldest federal reserve in the USA, and the tourist trade brought by the famous springs make it a very successful spa town.
Hot Springs is also the most dangerous city in America in terms of violent crime, which, according to the New York Times Almanac, occurred at a rate of 8,265 per 100,000 people.
The city takes its name from the natural thermal water that flows from 47 springs on the western slope of Hot Springs Mountain in the historic downtown district of the city. About a million gallons of 143-degree water flow from the springs each day. The rate of flow is not affected by fluctuations in the rainfall in the area.

Harry Keel was born in Gillespie, Illinois, to Navyman-turned-coalminer Homer Keel and his wife, Grace Osterkamp Keel. (It is often stated that his birth name was Harold Leek; this was a mistake made by the MGM publicity department in the 1950s.)
Young Harry spent his childhood in poverty. As a young boy in Gillespie one of his teachers, Miss Rosa Burke, noticed Harry wasn&#39;t eating any lunch. From that day forward, Miss Burke would pack two lunches,&amp;#8212;one for herself and one for Harry. When Harry became famous and would perform near Gillespie, Miss Burke was always sent tickets to attend his performances.
After his father&#39;s death in 1930, he and his mother moved to California, where he graduated from Fallbrook High School at the age of 17 and took various odd jobs until finally settling at Douglas Aircraft Company, where he became a traveling representative.
At the age of 20, he was overheard singing by his landlady, Mom Rider, and was encouraged to take vocal lessons. One of his musical heroes was the great baritone Lawrence Tibbett and Howard would later&lt;/p&gt;

He has had a successful career in theatre; he has been cast in many plays, while occasionally directing others.
Although McDiarmid has appeared mostly in theatrical productions, he has also accepted roles in theatrical films and TV movies. Worldwide, he is most famous for his role as Palpatine in both the original and prequel Star Wars trilogies.
McDiarmid was born in Carnoustie. He became a theatre aficionado when he was five years old, when his father took him to see an act by the name of Tommy Morgan in a theatre located in Dundee. In 2004 he stated, &quot;It sort of fascinated me, and it also scared me. All those lights, all that make-up. I said to myself, &#39;I don&#39;t know what this is, but I want it.&#39;&quot; However, fearing his father&#39;s disapproval, McDiarmid attended the University of St Andrews, where he received an M.A. in psychology. Soon after, he decided to pursue a career in the theatre instead, and took acting training courses at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow. In 1968,&lt;/p&gt;

Although he has starred in a number of films, it is by his television roles that he is generally known, starting with the BBC&#39;s Lovejoy and particularly in the HBO Western drama Deadwood. In 2009 he starred in the NBC series Kings as King Silas Benjamin.
Ian McShane was born in Blackburn, Lancashire, the son of Irene (n&amp;#233;e Cowley) and Harry McShane. McShane grew up in Urmston, Lancashire and attended Stretford Grammar School.
In 1977, he began a turbulent five-year relationship with Sylvia Kristel after meeting her on the set of The Fifth Musketeer. He is married to Gwen Humble.
In the United Kingdom, his best known role may be that of roguish but dashing antiques dealer Lovejoy in the BBC drama series of the same name. He also enjoyed fame in the United States as bounding English cad Don Lockwood in the soap opera Dallas and as an English cockfighting aficionado in the mini-series Roots. Even before Lovejoy, McShane was a pin-up as a result of appearances in television series such as Wuthering Heights (1967, as Heathcliff), Jesus of Nazareth (1977, as Judas Iscariot), and Disraeli (1978) &amp;#8212; as well as films like Sky West and&lt;/p&gt;

It is The German Capital of Gemstone Industry. The city lies on the Nahe River, in the district of Birkenfeld. It is the largest city in the Hunsr&amp;#252;ck region of southwest Germany, and has a population of around 35,000.
The towns of Idar and Oberstein belonged to the barons of Daun-Oberstein (who later became the counts of Falkenstein) until 1670. In 1865, both Idar and Oberstein were chartered as cities, and finally in 1933, they united (along with the smaller towns of Algenrodt and Tiefenstein) to form the modern town of Idar-Oberstein.
The Felsenkirche, aka the Church of the Rock, and two ruined medieval castles are perched on the hills above the town, and are, after gemstones and jewelry, the chief tourist attractions in the city. Schloss Oberstein was the site of &quot;Tschuess Fest,&quot; a festival celebrating German-American friendship. It was held on April 21, 2007 and had over 500 attendees. Additionally, it served as a farewell to the area&#39;s two main American socialites, Jason O.

It is the seventh-largest country by geographical area, the second-most populous country with over 1.18 billion people, and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the west, and the Bay of Bengal on the east, India has a coastline of 7,517&amp;#160;kilometres (4,700&amp;#160;mi). It is bordered by Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Burma to the east. India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka, and the Maldives in the Indian Ocean.
Home to the Indus Valley Civilisation and a region of historic trade routes and vast empires, the Indian subcontinent was identified with its commercial and cultural wealth for much of its long history. Four major religions, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism originated here, while Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam arrived in the first millennium CE and shaped the region&#39;s diverse culture. Gradually annexed by the British East India Company from the early eighteenth century and colonised by the United Kingdom&lt;/p&gt;

For decades the major industry of the town was coal mining, but as mines closed throughout the latter half of the twentieth century the area has had ongoing economic difficulty. Natural gas surveying and production have picked up some of the slack, and Indiana serves as the home of the largest privately owned drilling company in the United States, S.W. Jack Drilling Company.

It is approximately 200&amp;#160;km (125 miles) north of Kuala Lumpur via the North-South Expressway.
Ipoh developed into one of Malaysia&#39;s main cities due to the booming tin mining industry around the turn of the 19th century. During the British colonial era, Ipoh was Malaysia&#39;s second city for administration purposes. There are several notable buildings from the British Colonial era such as the railway station and the town hall. 70% of Ipoh&#39;s population is of Chinese origin.
The name Ipoh is derived from a local tree, pohon epu or now more commonly known as pokok ipoh. The sap of this plant is poisonous and was used by Orang Asli (indigenous people) to coat the tips of the darts of their blowpipes.
The Cantonese name for Ipoh derives the word Yee Poh meaning found treasure. This is because the Hoi San which are Cantonese were the first to move to the area for mining. They then build a small town for trading of food and hardware for the miner. They were happy with the new found tin mining town and name it &quot;yee poh&quot; (found treasure).
Ipoh is sometimes called &quot;Paloh&quot; (Chinese: &amp;#22761;&amp;#32645;) among local Chinese,&lt;/p&gt;

It borders Lebanon in the north, Syria in the northeast, Jordan and the West Bank in the east, the Gaza Strip and Egypt on the southwest, and contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel is the world&#39;s only predominantly Jewish state, with a population of 7.5&amp;#160;million people, of whom 5.7&amp;#160;million are Jewish. Arab citizens of Israel form the country&#39;s second-largest ethnic group, which includes Muslims, Christians, Druze, and Samaritans.
The modern State of Israel has its historical and religious roots in the Biblical Land of Israel, also known as Zion, a concept central to Judaism since ancient times. Political Zionism took shape in the late-19th century and the Balfour Declaration of 1917 formalized British policy preferring the establishment of a Jewish state. Following World War I, the League of Nations granted Great Britain the Mandate for Palestine&lt;/p&gt;

He is mainly referred to by his nickname Jackie Boy. In the 2005 film adaptation of the comic books, he was portrayed by Benicio del Toro.
In the commentaries on the Sin City DVD, Miller has stated that at one time, Jack Rafferty was, in fact, a decent cop. However, after years on the force, he seemingly ended up being corrupted and worn down from the job. He specifically said how the Jack Rafferty we see in the movie is at rock bottom. Miller has confirmed there will be a graphic novel coming soon showing the rise and fall of Rafferty.
At the beginning of The Big Fat Kill, a drunken Rafferty is paying a visit to his old girlfriend Shellie. She wants nothing to do with him, but when he threatens to break down the door to her apartment, she lets him in out of fear, along with his pack of equally drunk friends. He wants her to call some stripper and waitress friends of hers and hit the town with him and his &#39;troops&#39;. After she refuses, Rafferty strikes Shellie in the face after claiming he had never hit a woman in his life. While relieving himself in the bathroom, he is&lt;/p&gt;

It is situated in the Caribbean Sea, about 145&amp;#160;kilometres (90&amp;#160;mi) south of Cuba, and 190&amp;#160;kilometres (120&amp;#160;mi) west of Hispaniola, the island harboring the nation-states Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Its indigenous Arawakan-speaking Ta&amp;#237;no inhabitants named the island Xaymaca, meaning the &quot;Land of Wood and Water&quot;, or the &quot;Land of Springs&quot;.
Once a Spanish possession known as Santiago, in 1655 it became the English, and later the British, colony known as &quot;Jamaica&quot;. With 2.8 million people, it is the third most populous anglophone country in the Americas, after the United States and Canada. It remains a Commonwealth realm with Queen Elizabeth II as Head of State. Kingston is the largest city in Jamaica and the country&#39;s capital.
The Arawak and Taino indigenous people originating from South America settled on the island between 4000 and 1000 BC. When Christopher Columbus arrived in 1494 there were over 200 villages ruled by caciques (chiefs of villages). The south coast of Jamaica was the most populated,&lt;/p&gt;

Doohan&#39;s characterization of the Scottish Chief Engineer of the Starship Enterprise was one of the most recognizable elements in the Star Trek franchise, for which he also made several contributions behind the scenes. Many of the characterizations, mannerisms, and expressions that he established for Scotty and other Star Trek characters have become entrenched in popular culture.
Following his success with Star Trek, he supplemented his income and showed continued support for his fans by making numerous public appearances. Doohan often went to great lengths to buoy the large number of fans who have been inspired to make their own accomplishments in engineering and other fields, as a result of Doohan&#39;s work and his encouragement. Doohan was considered by some to be one of the most giving and affable stars of the Star Trek franchise.
Doohan, pronounced /&amp;#712;du&amp;#720;&amp;#601;n/ (DOO-&amp;#601;n), was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, the youngest of four children of William and Sarah Doohan, who emigrated&lt;/p&gt;

(n&amp;#233;e Smith), operated a pre-school after her husband&#39;s death and re-married to Thomas E. Dixon. Woods grew up in Warwick, Rhode Island, where he attended Pilgrim High School.
Woods chose to pursue his undergraduate studies at MIT, where he majored in political science (though he originally planned on a career as a surgeon). While at MIT, Woods pledged to Theta Delta Chi Fraternity. He was also an active member of the student theatre group &quot;Dramashop&quot; where he both acted in and directed a number of plays. He dropped out of MIT in 1969 just before his graduation in order to pursue a career in acting. Woods has said that he became an actor because of the father of Ben Affleck, Tim Affleck, who was a stage manager at the theatre company in Boston while Woods was at MIT.

He is voiced by Trey Parker. For the first eight seasons of the series, the character was known as Mr. Garrison but in season 9 underwent sex reassignment surgery. The character was thereafter known to the other characters as Mrs. Garrison, despite being unmarried. In the season 12 episode, &quot;Eek, a Penis!&quot;, he undergoes yet another sex change operation (back to a man). Garrison is particularly cynical, especially in comparison with the rest of South Park&#39;s adults, and he is one of the few characters to ever break the fourth wall on the show. He is also left handed.
The Mr. Garrison character was in part inspired by a Kindergarten teacher Trey Parker had in the Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools who used a puppet named Mr. Hat as a teaching resource. Mr. Garrison was also inspired by a British Literature professor Parker had at the University of Colorado; Parker said the voice he uses for the character is a dead-accurate impression of him. Parker said he believes Mr. Garrison has become one of the most complex characters on South Park, particularly due&lt;/p&gt;

Located in the Pacific Ocean, it lies to the east of the Sea of Japan, China, North Korea, South Korea and Russia, stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Taiwan in the south. The characters which make up Japan&#39;s name mean &quot;sun-origin&quot;, which is why Japan is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Land of the Rising Sun&quot;.
Japan is an archipelago of 6,852 islands. The four largest islands are Honsh&amp;#363;, Hokkaid&amp;#333;, Ky&amp;#363;sh&amp;#363; and Shikoku, together accounting for 97% of Japan&#39;s land area. Most of the islands are mountainous, many volcanic; for example, Japan&amp;#8217;s highest peak, Mount Fuji, is a volcano. Japan has the world&#39;s tenth-largest population, with over 128&amp;#160;million people. The Greater Tokyo Area, which includes the de facto capital city of Tokyo and several surrounding prefectures, is the largest metropolitan area in the world, with over 30 million residents.
Archaeological research indicates that people were living on the islands of Japan as early as the Upper Paleolithic period. The first written mention of Japan begins with brief appearances in Chinese&lt;/p&gt;

It is a member of the Japonic (or Japanese-Ryukyuan) language family. There are a number of proposed relationships with other languages, but none of them has gained unanimous acceptance. Japanese is an agglutinative language. It is distinguished by a complex system of honorifics reflecting the nature of Japanese society, with verb forms and particular vocabulary to indicate the relative status of the speaker, the listener, and persons mentioned in conversation. The language has a relatively small sound inventory, and a lexically significant pitch-accent system. Japanese is a mora-timed language.
The Japanese language is written with a combination of three scripts: Chinese characters called kanji (&amp;#28450;&amp;#23383;), and two syllabic scripts made up of modified Chinese characters, hiragana (&amp;#12402;&amp;#12425;&amp;#12364;&amp;#12394; or &amp;#24179;&amp;#20206;&amp;#21517;) and katakana (&amp;#12459;&amp;#12479;&amp;#12459;&amp;#12490; or &amp;#29255;&amp;#20206;&amp;#21517;). The Latin alphabet, r&amp;#333;maji (&amp;#12525;&amp;#12540;&amp;#12510;&amp;#23383;), is also often used in modern Japanese, especially for company names and logos, advertising, and when entering Japanese text into a computer. Arabic numerals are generally used for numbers, but traditional&lt;/p&gt;

Depicted as deeply moral, highly logical and cerebral, Picard is a master of diplomacy and debate who resolves seemingly intractable issues between multiple parties. Though such resolutions are usually peaceful, Picard is also shown utilizing his remarkable tactical skills in situations when it is required.
After the success of the contemporary Star Trek feature films, a new television series featuring a new cast was announced on October 10, 1986. Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry named Picard for one or both of the twin brothers Auguste Piccard and Jean Felix Piccard, 20th-century Swiss scientists.

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Jean Arthur (October 17, 1900 &amp;#8211; June 19, 1991) was an American actress and a major film star of the 1930s and 1940s. She remains arguably the epitome of the female screwball comedy actress. As James Harvey wrote in his recounting of the era, &quot;No one was more closely identified with the screwball comedy than Jean Arthur. So much was she part of it, so much was her star personality defined by it, that the screwball style itself seems almost unimaginable without her.&quot; Arthur has been called &quot;the quintessential comedic leading lady.&quot;
Arthur is best known for her feature roles in three Frank Capra films: Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), You Can&#39;t Take It With You (1938), and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), films that championed the everyday heroine. A memorable later performance was in George Stevens&#39; Shane (1953), her last screen appearance.
Arthur was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress in 1944 for her performance in The More the Merrier (1943).
Arthur was born Gladys Georgianna Greene in Plattsburgh, New York to Johanna Augusta Nelson and Hubert Sidney Greene. She lived off and on in Westbrook, Maine from 1908 to 1915 while her father worked at Lamson Studios in&lt;/p&gt;

Hagen was born as Jean Shirley Verhagen in Chicago, Illinois, to Christian Verhagen (born August 10 1890 &amp;#8212; died April 1983), a Dutch immigrant, and his Chicago-born wife, Marie (born May 25, 1896 &amp;#8212; died 19??). The family moved to Elkhart, Indiana when she was 12 and she subsequently graduated from Elkhart High School. She studied drama and worked as a theater usherette before making her Broadway theatre debut in Another Part of the Forest in 1946.
Her film debut was as a femme fatale in Adam&#39;s Rib in 1949. The Asphalt Jungle (1950) provided Hagen with her first starring role beside Sterling Hayden, and excellent reviews. She is arguably best remembered for her comic performance in Singin&#39; in the Rain. As the vain and talentless silent movie star Lina Lamont, Hagen received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.
By 1953, she had joined the cast of the television sitcom Make Room for Daddy. As the first wife of Danny Thomas, Hagen received three Emmy Award nominations, but after three seasons she grew dissatisfied and left the series. Thomas, who also produced the show, reportedly didn&#39;t&lt;/p&gt;

As well as the island of Jersey itself, the bailiwick includes two groups of small islands which are no longer permanently inhabited, the Minquiers and &amp;#201;cr&amp;#233;hous, and the Pierres de Lecq and other rocks and reefs. Together with the bailiwick of Guernsey, it forms the grouping known as the Channel Islands. Like the Isle of Man, Jersey is a separate possession of the Crown and is not part of the United Kingdom. Jersey has an international identity different from that of the UK, although it belongs to the Common Travel Area and the definition of &quot;United Kingdom&quot; in the British Nationality Act 1981 is interpreted as including the UK and the Islands together. The United Kingdom is constitutionally responsible for the defence of Jersey. Jersey is not a full-member state of the European Union although it is included in the customs territory of the European Community.
Jersey history is influenced by its strategic location between the northern coast of France and the southern coast of England; the island&#39;s recorded history extends over&lt;/p&gt;

Starting as a dancer in traveling theatrical companies before debuting on Broadway, Crawford was signed to a motion picture contract by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1925. Initially frustrated by the size and quality of her parts, Crawford began a campaign of self-publicity and became nationally known as a flapper by the end of the 1920s. In the 1930s, Crawford&#39;s fame rivaled MGM colleagues Norma Shearer and Greta Garbo. Crawford often played hardworking young women who find romance and financial success. These &quot;rags-to-riches&quot; stories were well-received by Depression-era audiences and were popular with women. Crawford became one of Hollywood&#39;s most prominent movie stars and one of the highest paid women in the United States, but her films began losing money and by the end of the 1930s she was labeled &quot;box office poison&quot;.
After an absence of nearly two years from the screen, Crawford staged a comeback by starring in Mildred Pierce (1945), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. In 1955, she became involved with the Pepsi-Cola Company, through her marriage to company&lt;/p&gt;

In 1995-1996, Dante worked on The Phantom, and when he was removed from the film, he chose screen credit (as executive producer) rather than pay. He wished he had chosen pay when he saw the results. He was creative consultant on Eerie, Indiana (1991-1992) and directed five episodes. He played himself in the series finale.
Dante was born in Morristown, New Jersey. His father was a professional golf player. Dante began his movie career working for Roger Corman, similar to Francis Ford Coppola and James Cameron. He worked as an editor on films&lt;/p&gt;

Keaton, a Scots-Irish American, was born Joseph Hallie Keaton a few miles south of Terre Haute, Indiana. Keaton was born to Libbie (n&amp;#233;e Jane), and Joseph Francis Keaton IV. Joe and his wife Myra were both vaudeville performers. Joe and Myra&#39;s first son/child was Joseph Frank Keaton, who became known as the silent film actor Buster Keaton. Buster joined the act when he was only a few years old. The act was a rough-and-tumble one, with Buster being thrown around on stage most of the time. As the years went by, Joe Keaton became an alcoholic, which forced Buster to quit the act by the time he was a teenager. However, after he hit it big in silent film, Buster provided Joe with small parts in several movies. Myra and Joe split up long after Buster had become an adult. He lived alone in a Hollywood hotel for many years and was said to have stopped drinking after becoming a Christian Scientist. Buster said Joe died as a result of being struck by a car.
Joe Keaton eloped with Myra Edith Cutler, who became known as Myra Keaton on May 31, 1894, together they had three&lt;/p&gt;

A descendant of the renowned Terry acting family, he achieved early international acclaim for his youthful, emotionally expressive Hamlet which broke box office records on Broadway in 1937.

John Gielgud was born in South Kensington in London to Kate Terry and Frank Gielgud. He was of theatrical lineage on his mother&#39;s side, being the grandson of actress Kate Terry and the great nephew of Dame Ellen Terry, as well as of Marion Terry, Fred Terry, and all their actor siblings.
Gielgud&#39;s Catholic father, Franciszek Gie&amp;#322;gud, born 1880, was a descendant of a Polish-Lithuanian noble family residing at Gelgaudi&amp;#353;kis manor dating back to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (now a town in Marijampol&amp;#279; County, Lithuania).

Miller has announced he will be the main character of another story, set before That Yellow Bastard.
At the start of That Yellow Bastard, Hartigan is &quot;pushing 60.&quot; He has a distinguishing cross-shaped scar on his forehead. He is presented as a muscular and imposing man, capable of holding his own in a fight.

He is almost always dressed professionally, most commonly wearing an oxford shirt, tie, and dress slacks, along with his signature trenchcoat.
A veteran police detective of Basin City, Hartigan is gruff, stoic, and cynical. He is also completely selfless; he cares little about his own well-being as long as he can protect his fellow citizens. He risks his own safety and reputation to achieve safety for those he cares about, but this dedication eventually destroys his life.

In 1960 Junkin joined Joan Littlewood&#39;s Stratford East Theatre Workshop, and played the lead in the original production of Sparrows Can&#39;t Sing. A few years later he joined the Royal Court Theatre company and was the foil to Tony Hancock in some of Hancock&#39;s last work for British television. He played a diverse range of roles on the small screen; however he is best remembered for his comedy roles, and his appearances as a television quiz master. American moviegoers will remember him best for playing &quot;Shake&quot;, the assistant to Norman Rossington, in the Beatles movie A Hard Day&#39;s Night. In comedy roles, Junkin was rarely short of work, on account of his outstanding ability to play the stoney-faced symbol of low level, petty-minded and unquestioning authority, whether the army sergeant, police constable or site foreman. One of his rare leading roles was in the BBC series The Rough with the Smooth, in which he and Tim Brooke-Taylor played comedy writers (with both actors contributing scripts to the series as well).

He replaced the film&#39;s original assistant director, who suffered from a nervous breakdown and was sent home by the producers. While filming he met actors Don Rickles and Donald Sutherland, both of whom he would later cast in his own films. Following this, Landis worked on many films made in Europe (especially in Italy and England), most notably, Once Upon a Time in the West, El Condor and A Town Called Bastard. Landis also worked as a stunt double.

Larroquette was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of Bertha Oramous (n&amp;#233;e Helmstetter), a department store clerk, and John Edgar Larroquette, who was in the U.S. Navy. Larroquette&#39;s brother, Joseph, died during birth. His parents tried to adopt his cousin Larry Bouterie because he was born about the same time as Larroquette&#39;s brother, but Larry Bouterie&#39;s parents declined the offer. He played reed instruments as a child and moved to Los Angeles, California in 1973. The family lived in the middle Ninth Ward. Larroquette lived in New Orleans up until he was 22.

The population was 23,906 at the 2000 census. It is the principal city of the Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes Cambria County. As of 2008, the Metropolitan Statistical Area had a population of 144,319 which makes it one of the top 10 in the state.
Johnstown, settled in 1770, is perhaps most famous for its three floods which may have caused the decline in population and the reason to attract newcomers. The &quot;Great Flood&quot; of May 31, 1889 occurred after the South Fork Dam collapsed 14.1 miles (23&amp;#160;km) upstream from the city during heavy rains. At least 2,209 people died as a result of the flood and subsequent fire that raged through the debris. Other major floods occurred in 1936 and 1977.
Johnstown was formally organized as a town in 1800 by the Swiss German immigrant Joseph Johns (n&amp;#233; Josef Schantz). The settlement was initially known as Schantzstadt, but was soon changed to Johnstown. From 1834 to 1854, the city was a port and key transfer point along the Pennsylvania Main Line&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Joseph Cheshire Cotten (May 15, 1905 &amp;#8211; February 6, 1994) was an American actor of stage and film. He is best remembered for his association with Orson Welles, which led to appearances in Citizen Kane (1941), The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), Journey into Fear (1943), for which Cotten was also credited with the screenplay, and The Third Man (1949).
Cotten first achieved prominence on Broadway, starring in the original productions of The Philadelphia Story and Sabrina Fair. He became a recognizable Hollywood star in his own right with films such as Shadow of a Doubt (1943) and Portrait of Jennie (1948).
Cotten was born in Petersburg, Virginia, the son of Sallie Bartlett (n&amp;#233;e Willson) and Joseph Cheshire Cotten, Sr., who was an assistant postmaster. Cotten worked as an advertising agent after attending the Washington, D.C., Hickman School of Speech and Expression, where he studied acting. His work as a theatre critic inspired him to become more involved in theatre productions, first in Virginia, and later in New York. Cotten made his Broadway debut in 1930, and soon befriended up-and-coming actor/director/producer Orson Welles. In 1937, he joined Welles&#39; Mercury Theatre Company,&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Juliusz Machulski (born 1955) is a Polish film director and screenplay writer. Son of noted actor Jan Machulski, Juliusz became notable for his comedies ridiculing the life in communist-ruled Poland of 1970s and 1980s.
Juliusz Machulski was born March 10, 1955 in Olsztyn, Poland, to parents, Jan Machulski and Halina Machulska.
In 1973 he moved to Warsaw, where he was admitted to the Polish Philology faculty of the Warsaw University. However, in 1975 he moved to &amp;#321;&amp;#243;d&amp;#378;, where he graduated from the &amp;#321;&amp;#243;d&amp;#378; Film School. His film debut was Vabank (1981), a comedy describing a story of two Polish gangsters of the 1930s. The film was a striking success, as was the science-fiction comedy Seksmisja of 1984. Often seen as either a golden child or enfant terrible of the Polish cinema, Machulski quickly became one of the most popular Polish directors, both in Poland and abroad. His Seksmisja, although significantly shortened by the Soviet censorship, was one of the most popular pictures shown in the Soviet Union in mid-1980s. Kingsajz, a fantasy comedy made in 1987 remains one of his most important movies till date due to its great social significance. It is in many ways similar to Seksmisja but&lt;/p&gt;

The performance later earned him a spot (#80) on VH1&#39;s 100 Greatest Kid Stars.
After his acting debut Kramer vs. Kramer, Henry&#39;s next role was in a 1983 episode of Fantasy Island.
On the big screen, Henry appeared in the 1984 Brat Pack film Sixteen Candles, playing younger brother to the protagonist played by Molly Ringwald. He played the son of a married couple played by Don Johnson and Susan Sarandon in the 1988 film Sweet Hearts Dance; Janet Maslin called him a &quot;large and amusingly sullen teen-ager&quot; in the role.
Henry then attended Skidmore College, earning a B.A. in psychology in 1993.
After graduation, his next widely-seen performance was in 1997, as a medical student in a two-episode role during the fourth season of ER. He also starred opposite Ally Sheedy and Brian O&#39;Halloran in the mockumentary The Junior Defenders, which was filmed that same year but&lt;/p&gt;

Kagoshima Prefecture is located at the southwest tip of Ky&amp;#363;sh&amp;#363; and includes a chain of islands stretching further to the southwest for a few hundred kilometers. The most important group is the Amami Islands. Surrounded by the Yellow Sea to the west, at least since 1879 by Okinawa Prefecture in the south, Kumamoto Prefecture to the north, and Miyazaki Prefecture to the east, it has 2,632&amp;#160;km of coastline (including the 28 islands). It has a bay called Kagoshima Bay (Kinkowan), which is sandwiched by two peninsulas, Satsuma and &amp;#332;sumi. Its position made it a &#39;gateway&#39; to Japan at various times in history. While Kyushu has about 13 million people there are less than 2 million in this prefecture.
The prefecture boasts a chain of active and dormant volcanoes, including the great Sakurajima, which towers out of the Kagoshima bay opposite Kagoshima city. A steady trickle of smoke and ash emerges from the caldera, punctuated by louder mini-eruptions on an almost daily basis. On active days in Kagoshima city an umbrella is advisable to ward off the ash.&lt;/p&gt;

The city is coterminous with Kampala District.
Mutesa I, the Kabaka (king) of Buganda, had chosen the area that was to become Kampala as one of his favorite hunting grounds. The area was made up of numerous rolling hills and lush wetlands. It was an ideal breeding ground for various game, particularly a species of antelope, the Impala (Aepyceros melampus). The origin of the word impala is likely from the Zulu language in South Africa.
The city grew as the capital of the Buganda kingdom, from which several buildings survive, including the Kasubi Tombs (built in 1881), the Buganda Parliament, the Buganda Court of Justice and the Naggalabi Buddo Coronation Site. Severely damaged in the Uganda-Tanzania War, the city has since then been rebuilt with constructions of new buildings including hotels, banks, shopping malls, educational institutions, hospitals and improvement of war torn buildings and infrastructure. Traditionally, Kampala was a city of seven hills, but over time it&lt;/p&gt;

He is perhaps best known for being the creator of the manga Akira and its anime adaptation, which are extremely famous and influential. Otomo has also directed several live-action films, such as the 2006 feature film adaptation of the Mushishi manga.
Katsuhiro Otomo was born in Miyagi Prefecture and grew up in Tome-gun. While he was in high-school he had a strong fascination for movies, often taking a three-hour train during school holidays just to see them. In 1973 he graduated high school and left Miyagi, heading to Tokyo with the hopes of becoming a manga artist. In October 4, 1973, he published his first work, a manga adaptation of Prosper Merimee&#39;s short novel Mateo Falcone, titled A Gun Report.
In 1979, after writing multiple short-stories for the magazine Action, Otomo created his first science-fiction work, titled Fireball. Although the manga was never completed, it is regarded as a milestone in Otomo&#39;s career as it contained many of the same themes he would explore in his later, more successful manga such as Domu. Domu began serialization in January&lt;/p&gt;

The population was 11,775 at the 2000 census.
Katy is named for the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad (commonly referred to as the &quot;K-T Railroad&quot;, now a part of Union Pacific) that ran through Katy in the 19th century. Katy was once known as Cane Island. The name is derived from Cane Island Creek which runs just west of downtown. Cane Creek is a branch of Buffalo Bayou. The origins of the name Cane Island are believed to be from the fact that Katy was once a major sugar cane producer and rice producer. To commermorate the importance of rice to the Katy community, the Chamber of Commerce holds the Rice Harvest Festival every second weekend of October.
Katy was recently the location of one of the ten large red balloons in the DARPA Network Challenge on December 5, 2009. The balloon was stationed in Katy Park.
In 2009 the Gadberry Group named Katy as one of nine &quot;9 from 2009&quot; most notable high growth areas in the United States.

Kaunas is located at the confluence of the two largest Lithuanian rivers, the Nemunas and the Neris, and near the Kaunas Reservoir, the largest body of water entirely in Lithuania.
The city&#39;s name is of Lithuanian origins and most likely derives from a personal name.
Before Lithuania regained independence, the city was generally known in English as Kovno, the traditional Slavicized form of its name; the Polish name is Kowno; the Belarusian name is Ko&amp;#1118;&amp;#1085;a. An earlier Russian name was &amp;#1050;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1074;&amp;#1085;&amp;#1086;, although &amp;#1050;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1091;&amp;#1085;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1089; has been used since 1940. The Yiddish name is Kovne (&amp;#1511;&amp;#1488;&amp;#1464;&amp;#1520;&amp;#1504;&amp;#1506;), while its names in German include Kaunas and Kauen. The city and its elderates also have names in other languages (see Names of Kaunas in other languages and names of Kaunas elderates in other languages).
One of the legends tells us, that Kaunas was established by Romans in ancient times. The head of this Romans group was the patrician Palemon, who had three sons: Barcus, Kunas and Sperus. Palemon went away from Rome, because he feared emperor Nero. So, he&lt;/p&gt;

Significant portions of Kenley lie within the London Green Belt. In particular, the south of Kenley is dominated by the open green spaces of Kenley Common and Kenley Aerodrome.
A comprehensive history of Kenley is found in the Bourne Society&#39;s &#39;Kenley Village History&#39;.
For centuries, Kenley was part of Coulsdon Manor which covered the whole area now known as Coulsdon, Old Coulsdon, Purley and Kenley. As with most of this area, Kenley was primarily farm land, with a few big houses and their estates.
The official opening of the railway on 4 August 1856 transformed Kenley. The new railway prompted urban development. By the end of the Victorian era, Kenley had assumed its own identity. Magnificent gentlemen&#39;s houses in substantial grounds were constructed during the 1860s. These houses gave Kenley its distinctive appearance on its western hillside. More modest housing and shops were built along the Godstone Road in the 1880s. Finally, the&lt;/p&gt;

Baker, who stands 3 ft 8 in (112 cm) tall, was a circus and cabaret performer with entertainer Jack Purvis when George Lucas hired him to be the man inside R2-D2 in Star Wars in 1977.
Baker appears in all six of the episodic theatrical Star Wars films. Baker played an additional role in 1983&#39;s Return of the Jedi as Paploo, the Ewok who steals an Imperial speeder bike. He was originally going to play Wicket, but he fell ill, and that role was handed over to Warwick Davis. Kenny is featured on Justin Lee Collins&#39;s &#39;Bring Back Star Wars&#39;. He revealed a feud between him and his co-star Anthony Daniels. He claimed Daniels had been rude to him on numerous occasions, and states that Daniels is rude to everyone, including fans. He even said he wouldn&#39;t be in the same room as Daniels unless necessary.
Baker&#39;s other films include The Elephant Man, Time Bandits (also with Purvis), Amadeus and Jim Henson&#39;s Labyrinth. On television, he appeared in the British medical drama Casualty.

Lying along the Indian Ocean, at the equator, Kenya is bordered by Ethiopia (north), Somalia (northeast), Tanzania (south), Uganda plus Lake Victoria (west), and Sudan (northwest). Kenya has numerous wildlife reserves, containing thousands of animal species. The capital city is Nairobi. Kenya&#39;s population of nearly 38 million is diverse - with more than 40 different cultures represented. The country is named after Mount Kenya, a significant landmark and the second among the highest mountain peaks of Africa.

US President Barack Obama&#39;s late father was a Kenyan. On November 4, 2008, the Government of Kenya declared a public holiday to celebrate Obama&#39;s success in the US elections.
The word Kenya, pronounced /&amp;#712;k&amp;#603;nj&amp;#601;/, originates from the Kikuyu, Embu and Kamba names for Mount Kenya, &quot;Kirinyaga&quot;, &quot;Kirinyaa&quot; and &quot;Kiinyaa&quot;.

According to the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 791. Keresley and Keresley End are two separate areas; Keresley is in Coventry, while the slightly more rural Keresely End, also known as Keresley village or Keresley Newlands, is in Warwickshire, with the exception of Thompsons Road in the village, which comes under the Coventry boundary. The village features two grocers shops, two bus stops, a beauty salon, primary school, doctors surgery, a fish and chip shop, a small church, a post office, library, park, garden centre and community centre.
For most of its history, Keresley was a combination of two further villages: Keresley Green was the most northerly and first to exist, but it was Keresley Heath to the south which was developed the most with the building of schools and the church of St. Thomas. However, in 1911 the construction of a colliery by the Warwickshire Coal Company near to Keresley Green brought the focus of development back to that area. It wasn&#39;t until 1974 that the two parts of Keresley lost their separate identities&lt;/p&gt;

After being revived in 2267 by the crew of the Enterprise, Khan attempts to capture the starship, but is thwarted by James T.

The character returns in the 1982 film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, set fifteen years after &quot;Space Seed&quot;, in which Khan escapes his imprisonment and sets out to seek revenge upon Kirk. The character was portrayed by Ricardo Montalb&amp;#225;n in both the television episode and in the film.
Initially conceived as a brutal man of Nordic ancestry, Khan first appears as a Sikh, who is both admired and opposed by the Enterprise crew.

The population as of the 2001 census was 2,611,300. However, higher numbers have been cited in the press.
Kiev is an important industrial, scientific, educational and cultural centre of Eastern Europe. It is home to many high-tech industries, higher education institutions and world-famous historical landmarks. The city has an extensive infrastructure and highly developed system of public transport, including the Kiev Metro. Kiev was classified as a Beta world city- as of 2004.
The name Kiev is said to derive from the name of Kyi, one of four legendary founders of the city (brothers Kyi, Shchek, Khoryv, and sister Lybid). During its history, Kiev, one of the oldest cities in Eastern Europe, passed through several stages of great prominence and relative obscurity. The city may have been founded in the 5th century as a trading post, perhaps part of the land of the early Slavs. It gradually acquired eminence as the centre of the East Slavic civilization,&lt;/p&gt;

Kigali was founded in 1907 under German colonial rule, but did not become the capital until Rwandan independence in 1962. The traditional capital was the seat of the mwami (king) in Nyanza, while the colonial seat of power was in Butare, then known as Astrida. Butare was initially the leading contender to be the capital of the new independent nation, but Kigali was chosen because of its more central location. Since then the city has grown very quickly and is now the major political, economic and cultural centre of Rwanda.

Kiribati was named Gilbert Islands after the British Captain Thomas Gilbert, who sighted the islands in 1788. The current name, Kiribati, is an adaptation of &quot;Gilberts&quot;, from the former European name the &quot;Gilbert Islands&quot;. Although the indigenous Gilbertese language name for the Gilbert Islands proper is Tungaru, the new state chose the name &quot;Kiribati&quot;, the Gilbertese rendition of &quot;Gilberts&quot;, as an equivalent of the former colony to acknowledge the inclusion of islands which were never considered&lt;/p&gt;

He is the father of Hollywood actor and producer Michael Douglas. He was #17 on the American Film Institute&#39;s list of the greatest male American screen legends of all time.
Douglas was born in Amsterdam, New York, to Bryna (n&amp;#233;e Sanglel) and Herschel &quot;Harry&quot; Danielovitch, a businessman. Douglas&#39;s parents were Russian Jewish immigrants from Gomel, now in independent Belarus. His father&#39;s brother, who emigrated earlier, used the surname Demsky, which Douglas&#39;s family adopted in the United States. Douglas grew up as Izzy Demsky, although he never legally changed his name.
Coming from a poor family, as a boy, Douglas sold snacks to mill workers to earn enough to buy milk and bread. Later, he delivered newspapers and claims to have worked at more than forty jobs before becoming an actor. He found living in a family of six sisters to be stifling, &quot;I was dying to get out. In a sense, it lit a fire under me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

The town was developed from the 1950s through 1970s as a means to house the overspill of Liverpool. It is situated roughly 5&amp;#160;miles (8&amp;#160;km) north of Huyton, the administrative HQ of the borough and about 6&amp;#160;miles (10&amp;#160;km) north-east of central Liverpool. The population of the town as of the 2001 census is 40,472. It is traditionally believed to be founded in 870 although there is evidence for settlement from the Bronze Age.
Historically a part of Lancashire, Kirkby is believed to have been founded circa 870, although archaeological digs have produced evidence of habitation in the Bronze Age. The name Kirk-by, literally meaning &quot;church&quot; and &quot;settlement&quot; is of Old Norse origin whose settlers arrived via Ireland around 900. The first direct evidence of a settlement dates from 1086 and the Domesday Book, with a reference to Cherchebi - population 70. Ownership of the land containing modern-day Kirkby - established as the West Derby Hundred in the 11th century - passed through many hands,&lt;/p&gt;

It is also the largest city in East Tennessee. As of the 2000 United States Census, Knoxville had a total population of 173,890; the July 2007 estimated population was 183,546. Knoxville is the principal city of the Knoxville Metropolitan Statistical Area with a metro population of 655,400, which is in turn the central component of the Knoxville-Sevierville-La Follette Combined Statistical Area with 1,029,155 residents.
Of Tennessee&#39;s four major cities, Knoxville is second oldest to Nashville, which was founded seven years earlier. After Tennessee&#39;s admission into the Union in 1796, Knoxville was the state&#39;s first capital, in which capacity it served until 1819, when the capital was moved to Murfreesboro, prior to Nashville receiving the designation. The city was named in honor of the first Secretary of War, Henry Knox.

Located on the Korean Peninsula, it borders China to the northwest, Russia to the northeast, and is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait.
Korea was united until 1948; at that time it was split into South Korea and North Korea. South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea, is a capitalist, democratic and developed country, with memberships in the United Nations, WTO, OECD and G-20 major economies. North Korea, officially the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea, is a single-party communist country founded by Kim Il-sung and currently led by his son Kim Jong-il.
Archaeological and linguistic evidence suggest the origins of the Korean people were in Altaic language-speaking people from south-central Siberia, who populated ancient Korea in successive waves from the Neolithic age to the Bronze Age. The adoption of the Chinese writing system (&quot;Hanja&quot; in Korean) in the 2nd century BC, and Buddhism in the 4th century AD, had profound effects on the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Korea later passed on these cultural advances to Japan.
Since the Goryeo Dynasty, Korea was ruled by a single&lt;/p&gt;

It is also one of the two official languages in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in China. There are about 78 million Korean speakers worldwide. In the 15th century a national writing system was commissioned by Sejong the Great, the system being currently called Hangul. Prior to the development of Hangul, Koreans used Hanja (Chinese characters) to write for over a millennium.
The genealogical classification of the Korean language is debated by a small number of linguists. Most classify it as a language isolate while a few consider it to be in the Altaic language family. Some believe it to be distantly related to Japanese-Ryukyuan. The Korean language is agglutinative in its morphology and SOV in its syntax.
The Korean names for the language are based on the names for Korea used in North and South Korea.
In South Korea, the language is most often called Hangungmal (&amp;#54620;&amp;#44397;&amp;#47568;; &amp;#38867;&amp;#22283;&amp;#47568;), or more formally, Hangugeo (&amp;#54620;&amp;#44397;&amp;#50612;; &amp;#38867;&amp;#22283;&amp;#35486;) or Gugeo (&amp;#44397;&amp;#50612;; &amp;#22283;&amp;#35486;; literally &quot;national language&quot;).
In North Korea and Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in China, the language is most often called Chos&amp;#335;nmal (&amp;#51312;&amp;#49440;&amp;#47568;; with hanja:&lt;/p&gt;

It is located beyond the eastern suburbs of the commercial capital Colombo and is often called New Capital Territory. The Parliament of Sri Lanka has been based there since the formal inauguration of its new building on 29 April 1982.
The village of Darugama lay at the confluence of two streams, the Diyawanna Oya and the Kolonnawa Oya. As Darugama was a naturally secure place, it was not easy for enemies to enter it. Here, in the 13th century, a chieftain named Nissanka Alagakkonara built a fortress called Kotte (meaning &#39;Fortress&#39;) against invasion from the Jaffna Kingdom of Arya Chakaravarthi.
Alagakkonara is mentioned by Ibn Batuta as ruling in Kurunegala, but other sources indicate that he was the Bandara (Guardian) of Raigama Korale (county) in the modern Kalutara District. Arya Chakravarthy&#39;s army was held by Alagakkonara in front of Kotte, while he defeated the enemy&#39;s invasion fleet at Panadura to the south-west.
Kotte was a jala durgha (water fortress), in the shape of a triangle,&lt;/p&gt;

Krak&amp;#243;w has traditionally been one of the leading centres of Polish academic, cultural and artistic life, and is one of Poland&#39;s most important economic centers.

It is now the capital of the Lesser Poland Voivodeship.
The city has grown from a Stone Age settlement to Poland&#39;s second most important city. It began as a hamlet on Wawel Hill, and was already being reported as a busy trading center of Slavonic Europe in 965.

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Kristoffer &quot;Kris&quot; Kristofferson (born June 22, 1936) is an American writer, singer-songwriter, actor, and musician. He is best known for hits such as &quot;Me and Bobby McGee&quot;, &quot;Sunday Mornin&#39; Comin&#39; Down&quot;, and &quot;Help Me Make It Through the Night&quot;. Kristofferson is the sole writer of most of his songs, but he has collaborated with various other figures of the Nashville scene such as Shel Silverstein and Fred Rumfelt.
Kristofferson was born in Brownsville, Texas, to parents Mary Ann (n&amp;#233;e Ashbrook) and Lars Henry Kristofferson, a U.S. Army Air Corps (later U.S. Air Force) major general. As is common with many military families, military service was a multi-generational tradition: Kristofferson&#39;s paternal grandfather was also an officer (in the Swedish Army). When Kristofferson was a child, his father pushed him toward a military career. Like most &quot;military brats&quot;, Kristofferson moved around frequently as a youth, finally settling down in San Mateo, California, where he graduated from San Mateo High School. An aspiring writer, Kristofferson enrolled in Pomona College in 1954. He experienced his first dose of fame when he appeared in Sports Illustrated&#39;s &quot;Faces In The Crowd&quot; for his&lt;/p&gt;

Landlocked and mountainous, it is bordered by Kazakhstan to the north, Uzbekistan to the west, Tajikistan to the southwest and People&#39;s Republic of China to the east. Its capital and largest city is Bishkek.
The ethnonym &quot;Kyrgyz&quot;, after which the country is named, is thought to originally mean &quot;forty tribes&quot;, presumably referring to the epic hero Manas who, as legend has it, unified forty tribes against the Khitans. The 40-ray sun on the flag of Kyrgyzstan symbolizes the forty tribes of Manas. It might also refer to &amp;#8220;red&amp;#8221;, the colour of the &amp;#8220;south country&amp;#8221; of the original Turkic nations.
The April 2010 riots caused the ex-president, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, to flee the country.
The original meaning of the word Kyrgyz has many interpretations. One variant alleges that &quot;kyrgyz&quot; originally meant &amp;#8220;red&amp;#8221;. This colour also marked the &amp;#8220;south country&amp;#8221; of original Turkic nations. Another variant is from the old Karakalpak epos, where the term &amp;#8220;kyrk kyz&amp;#8221; (meaning &quot;forty girls&quot;) is mentioned, which&lt;/p&gt;

The word Laleham probably comes from &#39;lael&#39; meaning twig and &#39;ham&#39; meaning water meadow or village.
It is possible that there was a 1st century Roman marching camp on the field which is now part of The Matthew Arnold School.
Iron Age spearheads from the 5th century have been found in the River Thames at Laleham Ferry. 10th Century charts record the village of Laelham.
Laleham appears in the Middlesex section of the Domesday Book of 1086 as Leleham. It was held partly by F&amp;#233;camp Abbey from Robert of Mortain and partly by Estrild, the nun. Its domesday assets were: 10 hides. It had 6&amp;#189; ploughs, meadow for 5 ploughs, cattle pasture. It rendered &amp;#163;5.

It is part of the district of Kaiserslautern, in the Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is situated on the north-western edge of the Palatinate forest, approx. 10&amp;#160;km west of Kaiserslautern.
It is perhaps best known in the United States of America because of the U.S. Army&#39;s medical installation. The Landstuhl Army Regional Medical Center (LARMC), a U.S. Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) post, is often the first stop for American casualties leaving the ongoing conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan. Ramstein Air Base is also located nearby.
The earliest traces of human settlement in Landstuhl are from 500 B.C. From the Celtic period is the &amp;#8220;Heidenfels&amp;#8221; (i.e. heathen rock), which was a holy site even into Roman times. From the Roman period is a settlement from the 1st Century A.D.
In the 15th Century, the von Sickingen noble family assumed responsibility for Landstuhl and the surrounding area. The most famous member of this family was Franz von Sickingen. Franz von Sickingen built his castle in Landstuhl &amp;#8211; Burg Nanstein (the most visible landmark in Landstuhl and the surrounding area) -&lt;/p&gt;

Bryggman attended the City College of San Francisco as well as the American Theatre Wing in New York. He made his off-Broadway debut in 1962, with A Summer Ghost.
Bryggman is known for his role as Dr. John Dixon in the soap opera As the World Turns, a role he played from July 18, 1969 to December 14, 2004.

Olivier played a wide variety of roles on stage and screen from Greek tragedy, Shakespeare and Restoration comedy to modern American and British drama. He was the first artistic director of the National Theatre of Great Britain and its main stage is named in his honour. He is generally regarded to be the greatest actor of the 20th century, in the same category as David Garrick, Richard Burbage, Edmund Kean and Henry Irving in their own centuries. Olivier&#39;s AMPAS acknowledgments are considerable&amp;#160;&amp;#8212; fourteen Oscar nominations, with two wins (for Best Actor and Best Picture for the 1948 film Hamlet), and two honorary awards including a statuette and certificate.

Kasdan was born in Miami, Florida. He was raised in Morgantown, West Virginia, where he graduated from Morgantown High School in 1966.
He graduated from the University of Michigan with an MA in Education, originally planning on a career as an English teacher. He was a student of Professor Kenneth Thorpe Rowe. Upon graduation, Kasdan was unable to find a teaching position, so he became an advertising copywriter, a profession he found so loathsome he refused to bring a second child into the world until he escaped it. Still, he labored at it for five years (even picking up a Clio Award along the way), first in Detroit and later in Los Angeles where he tried to interest Hollywood in his screenplays.
Kasdan&#39;s introduction into the film business came in the mid-1970s when he sold his script for The Bodyguard to Warner Bros. as a vehicle for Diana Ross and Steve McQueen. The script became stuck in &quot;development hell&quot; and became one of several scripts successively called &quot;the best un-made film in Hollywood&quot;; it was eventually produced as a 1992 film starring Whitney Houston and Kevin&lt;/p&gt;

Thompson was born in Rochester, Minnesota, the daughter of Barbara, a singer and musician, and Cliff Thompson. She studied ballet as a girl and would practice three to four hours every day.

Thompson was told by ballet legend and then ABT artistic director Mikhail Baryshnikov that she was &quot;a beautiful dancer, but too stocky.&quot; Due to this (as well as some small nagging past injuries), she decided to give up dancing in favor of an acting career.

Leigh Taylor-Young was born on January 25, 1945 in Washington, DC. Her last name is an amalgamation of the last names of her father, a diplomat, and her stepfather, a successful Detroit executive. She was raised in Oakland County, Michigan, and graduated high school in Detroit. Before attending Northwestern University as an economics major, she spent a summer shifting scenery and sweeping up at a Detroit little theater. However, she left before graduating to pursue a full-time acting career, making her professional debut on Broadway in Three Bags Full. About dropping out of college, the actress explained:
Taylor-Young got her first big break in 1966, when she was cast as Rachel Welles in the prime time soap opera Peyton Place. Her character was written in the show as a replacement for the character of Allison MacKenzie, previously played by Mia Farrow. The show&#39;s producer, Everett Chambers, casted her because of her &quot;great warmth and sweet angelic qualities not unlike Mia&quot;. By the time she received the role, Taylor-Young had been in California for only a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

McCoy and Kirk are good friends, even &quot;brotherly&quot;.

McCoy often plays the role of Kirk&#39;s conscience, offering a counterpoint to Spock&#39;s logic. McCoy is suspicious of technology, especially the transporter; as a physician, he prefers less intrusive treatment and believes in the body&#39;s innate recuperative powers.

Although Nielsen&#39;s acting career crosses a variety of genres in both television and films, he has achieved his greatest film successes as Commander John J. Adams in the film Forbidden Planet, and also in comic movies, including Airplane! and The Naked Gun series. His portrayal of serious characters seemingly oblivious of (and complicit in) their absurd surroundings gives Nielsen a reputation as a comedian.
Leading roles in the science fiction classic Forbidden Planet and as the ship&#39;s captain in The Poseidon Adventure came long before Nielsen considered a turn to comedy. His deadpan delivery as a doctor in 1980&#39;s Airplane! marked a turning point in Nielsen&#39;s career, one that would make him, in the words of film critic Roger Ebert, &quot;the Olivier of spoofs.&quot; He may be best known for his roles as Frank Drebin in The Naked Gun, Dr. Rumack in Airplane!, as well as President Harris in the Scary Movie series. Nielsen has appeared in over 100 films and 1,500 television programs over the span of his career, portraying over 220 characters.

It is just over 30,000&amp;#160;km (11,583&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi) in size with an estimated population of almost 1,800,000. Its capital and largest city is Maseru. Lesotho is the southernmost landlocked country in the world. It is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. The name &quot;Lesotho&quot; translates roughly into &quot;the land of the people who speak Sesotho&quot;. About 40% of the population live below the international poverty line of US$1.25 a day.
The earliest known inhabitants of the area were Khoisan hunter-gatherers. They were largely replaced by Wasja-speaking tribes during Bantu migrations. The Sotho-Tswana people colonized the general region of South Africa between the 3rd and 11th centuries.
The present Lesotho (then called Basutoland) emerged as a single polity under the Great King Moshoeshoe I in 1822. Son of Mokhachane, a minor chief of the Bakoteli lineage, Moshoeshoe formed his own clan and became a chief around 1804. Between 1821 and 1823 he and his followers settled at the Butha-Buthe Mountain, joining with former&lt;/p&gt;

Archaeological evidence points to prehistoric dwellers and it is thought that the Roman settlement of Mutuantonis was here, quantities of artifacts having been discovered in the area. The Saxons built a castle here, having first constructed its motte as a defensive point over the river; they gave the town its name.
After the Norman invasion Lewes was given by William the Conqueror to William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey. He built Lewes Castle on the Saxon site; and he and his wife, Gundred also founded a Cluniac priory here in about 1081. Lewes was the site of a mint during the Late Anglo-Saxon period and thereafter a mint during the early years after the Norman invasion. In 1148 the town was granted a charter by King Stephen. The town became a port with docks along the Ouse.
The town was the site of the Battle of Lewes between the forces of Henry III and&lt;/p&gt;

As of the 2008 Census, the nation is home to 3,476,608 people and covers 111,369&amp;#160;square kilometres (43,000&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi).
Liberia&#39;s capital is Monrovia. Liberia has a hot equatorial climate with most rainfall arriving in summer with harsh harmattan winds in the dry season. Liberia&#39;s populated Pepper Coast is composed of mostly mangrove forests while the sparsely populated inland is forested, later opening to a plateau of drier grasslands.
The history of Liberia is unique among African nations because of its relationship with the United States. It is one of the few countries in Africa, and the only country in West Africa, without roots in the European Scramble for Africa. It was founded and colonized by freed American slaves with the help of a private organization called the American Colonization Society in 1821-1822, on the premise that former American slaves would have greater freedom and equality there.
Slaves freed from slave ships also were sent there instead of being repatriated to their countries of&lt;/p&gt;

The area was inhabited by the Mpongw&amp;#233; tribe long before the French acquired the land in 1839. In 1846, L&#39;Elizia, a Brazilian ship carrying slaves for sale, was captured by the French navy near Loango. The slaves were freed and founded Libreville (French for &quot;Freetown&quot;) in 1848. It was the chief port of French Equatorial Africa from 1934 to 1946 and was the central focus of the Battle of Gabon in 1940.
Libreville was named in imitation of Freetown and grew only slowly as a trading post and a minor administrative centre to a population of 32,000 on independence in 1960. It only received its first bank branch when Bank of West Africa (BAO) opened a branch in 1930. Since independence, the city has grown rapidly and now houses nearly half the national population.
From north to south, major districts of the city are the residential area Batterie IV, Quartier Louis (known for its nightlife), Mont-Bou&amp;#235;t and Nombak&amp;#233;l&amp;#233; (busy commercial areas), Glass (the first European settlement in Gabon), Oloumi (a&lt;/p&gt;

It is located in the valleys of the Chill&amp;#243;n, R&amp;#237;mac and Lur&amp;#237;n rivers, on a desert coast overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Together with the seaport of Callao, it forms a contiguous urban area known as the Lima Metropolitan Area. Lima is the 4th largest city in Latin America, behind S&amp;#227;o Paulo, Mexico City, and Rio de Janeiro. Lima has the third largest Human Development Index in South America after Brazil, Argentina and Chile. Today, it is a major beta world city.
Lima was founded by Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro on January 18, 1535, as La Ciudad de los Reyes, or &quot;The City of Kings.&quot; It became the capital and most important city in the Spanish Viceroyalty of Peru. Following the Peruvian War of Independence, it became the capital of the Republic of Peru. Today, around one-third of the Peruvian population lives in the metropolitan area.
According to early Spanish chronicles the Lima area was once called Itchyma, after its original inhabitants. However, even before the Inca occupation of the area in the 15th century, a famous oracle in the R&amp;#237;mac valley had come to be known by visitors as limaq (limaq, pronounced [&amp;#712;lim&amp;#593;q], which means&lt;/p&gt;

The non-metropolitan district of Lincoln has a population of 85,595; the 2001 census gave the entire urban area of Lincoln a population of 120,779. The council identifies a &#39;Greater Lincoln&#39; catchment area covering surrounding villages and towns, which has a population of 250,000.
It has several twin towns: Port Lincoln, South Australia; Radomsko, Poland; Tangshan, China; and Neustadt an der Weinstra&amp;#223;e, Germany.
The earliest origins of Lincoln can be traced to the remains of an Iron Age settlement of round wooden dwellings (which were discovered by archaeologists in 1972) that have been dated to the 1st century BC This settlement was built by a deep pool (the modern Brayford Pool) in the River Witham at the foot of a large hill (on which the Normans later built Lincoln Cathedral and Lincoln Castle) .
The origins of the name Lincoln may come from this period, when the settlement is thought to have been named in the Brythonic language of Iron Age Britain&#39;s Celtic inhabitants as Lindon &quot;The Pool&quot;, presumably referring to the Brayford Pool. It is not possible to know how big this original&lt;/p&gt;

The MSA is in turn included in the Little Rock&amp;#8211;North Little Rock&amp;#8211;Pine Bluff, Arkansas Combined Statistical Area, which had a population of 862,488 in the 2009 census estimates. As of 2008, according to the US census, Little Rock had a population of 189,515.
Located near the geographic center of Arkansas, Little Rock derives its name from a small rock formation on the south bank of the Arkansas River called la Petite Roche (French: &quot;the little rock&quot;). The &quot;little rock&quot; was used by early river traffic as a landmark and became a well-known river crossing.
Archeological artifacts provide evidence of Native Americans&#39; inhabiting Central Arkansas for thousands of years before European settlers arrived. The early inhabitants may have included the Folsom people, Bluff Dwellers, and Mississippian culture peoples who built earthwork mounds recorded in 1541 by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto&#39;s expedition.

It was founded as a borough in 1207 and was granted city status in 1880. Liverpool is the fourth largest city in the United Kingdom and has a population of 435,500, and lies at the centre of the wider Liverpool Urban Area, which has a population of 816,216.
Historically a part of Lancashire, the urbanisation and expansion of Liverpool were largely brought about by the city&#39;s status as a major port. By the 18th century, trade from the West Indies, Ireland and mainland Europe coupled with close links with the Atlantic Slave Trade furthered the economic expansion of Liverpool. By the early 19th century, 40% of the world&#39;s trade passed through Liverpool&#39;s docks, contributing to Liverpool&#39;s rise as a major city.
Inhabitants of Liverpool are referred to as Liverpudlians but are also known as &quot;Scousers&quot;, in reference to the local dish known as &quot;scouse&quot;, a form of stew. The word &quot;Scouse&quot; has also become synonymous with the Liverpool accent and dialect.

Livingston was incorporated as a township by an Act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 5, 1813, from portions of Caldwell Township (now Fairfield Township) and Springfield Township (now in Union County, New Jersey). Portions of the township were taken to form Fairmount (March 11, 1862, now part of West Orange) and Roseland (March 10, 1908).
The township was given its name in honor of William Livingston, the first Governor of New Jersey with his family coat of arms as its seal.
Livingston&#39;s history dates back in 1699 when 101 Newark settlers wanted to expand westward. They set up a committee to negotiate the purchase from Lenni Lenape for the Horseneck Tract which today includes Livingston and eight other towns to the north. Between 1698 and 1702, the rules for property ownership were unclear. There were many disputes between settlers and the British proprietors. For some unknown reasons, the Newark settlers did not obtain a grant from the proprietors before negotiating with the natives. They finally obtained the deed directly from&lt;/p&gt;

Originally wooded farm land, in A.D. 535 two monks came eastwards from the small religious settlement of Llandaff, aiming to establish new settlements, or &quot;llans&quot;, in the land below Caerphilly mountain. With fresh water from the Nant Fawr stream, one of the monks Isan founded his llan on the site of the modern day Oval Park.

The city was founded in the eighteenth century by the Ewe people.
The city&#39;s population grew rapidly in the second half of the twentieth century. Indeed, if the city had approximately 30,000 inhabitants in 1950, by 1960 (the year Togo gained its Independence from France) the population had reached 80,000 and 200,000 by 1970.
From the year 1975, investments were increasingly huge, but not always in areas which had been targeted for development, and Togo, being a small country open to all winds, was a hub of trade between its more powerful neighbors. At the same time, it was a tragedy because of the deteriorating railways, which have an important role in serving the suburbs of the city.
Moreover, one can see the development of market gardening around the city, spurred by growing unemployment, rural migration and the demand for vegetables. Market gardening, first extended to the north, is mainly on the&lt;/p&gt;

Lord Farquaad is the comically short-in-stature, ruthless ruler of the huge castle of Duloc. Several times in the film it is commented that, in Duloc&#39;s towering height, Farquaad may be compensating for something.
In his pursuit of perfection, Farquaad attempts to rid his kingdom of fairy tale creatures, offering a bounty for their capture and then exiling imprisoned creatures to Shrek&#39;s swamp. However, because Farquaad is not of royal stock, he cannot become a king until he marries a princess. He decides that Princess Fiona will be the perfect wife and queen, but she first must be rescued from her tower guarded by a fire-breathing dragon.
Unwilling or unable (likely both) to perform the feat himself, Farquaad decides to hold a tournament to discover the knight that will rescue Princess Fiona when Donkey and Shrek arrive. Shrek and Donkey defeat the knights and Farquaad decides to send Shrek instead on the quest. Lord Farquaad agrees to move the fairy tale creatures out of Shrek&#39;s swamp if Shrek rescues Fiona.

Lenya was born as Karoline Wilhelmine Charlotte Blamauer to working class Roman Catholic parents in Vienna. She moved to study in Z&amp;#252;rich in 1914, taking up her first job at the Schauspielhaus using the stage name Lotte Lenja. She moved to Berlin to seek work in 1921.
In 1922 Lenya was seen by her future husband, the German composer Kurt Weill, during an audition for his first stage score Zaubernacht, but because of his position behind the piano, she did not see him. She was cast, but owing to her loyalty to her voice teacher who was not, she declined the role. She accepted the part of Jenny in the first performance of The Threepenny Opera (Die&lt;/p&gt;

Since 2003, the city&#39;s borders have been coterminous with those of the county because of a city-county merger. The city&#39;s estimated population as of 2008 was 713,877 (consolidated; balance total is 557,224), with a population of 1,244,696 in the Louisville metropolitan area. An important internal shipping port in the 19th century, Louisville is today most well known for the Kentucky Derby, the widely watched first race of the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing.
Louisville is situated on the Ohio River in north-central Kentucky at the Falls of the Ohio. Because it includes counties in Southern Indiana, the Louisville metropolitan area is often referred to as Kentuckiana. The river forms the border between Kentucky and Indiana. A resident of Louisville is referred to as a Louisvillian. Although situated in a Southern state, Louisville is influenced by both Southern and Midwestern culture. It is sometimes referred to as either the northernmost Southern city or the southernmost Northern city in the United States.

It is roughly bounded by Allen Street, East Houston Street, Essex Street, Canal Street, Eldridge Street, East Broadway, and Grand Street. It has traditionally been an immigrant, working class neighborhood, but has undergone rapid gentrification in recent years, prompting The National Trust for Historic Preservation to place the neighborhood on their list of America&#39;s Most Endangered Places.
While the exact western and southern boundaries of the neighborhood are open to debate, the Lower East Side today refers to the area of Manhattan south of East Houston Street and west of the East River.
The Lower East side is bordered in the south and west by Chinatown (which extends north to roughly Grand Street), in the west by NoLIta and in the north by East Village.
The Lower East Side is located in New York&#39;s 8th, 12th and 14th congressional districts, the New York State Assembly&#39;s 64th district, the New York State Senate&#39;s 25th district, and New York City Council&#39;s 1st and 2nd district.

According to the 2000 U.S. Census, the city population was 199,564, making it the 90th largest city in the United States and the 11th largest in Texas. The 2006 population was estimated to be 212,169. Lubbock County had an estimated 2006 population of 254,862.
Lubbock&#39;s nickname is the &quot;Hub City&quot; which derives from being the economic, education, and health care hub of a multi-county region commonly called the South Plains. The area is the largest contiguous cotton-growing region in the world and is heavily dependent on irrigation water drawn from the Ogallala Aquifer.
The county of Lubbock was founded in 1876, named after Thomas Saltus Lubbock, a Confederate colonel and member of the Terry&#39;s Texas Rangers, a group of Texas volunteers for the Confederate Army. As early as 1884, a federal post office named Lubbock existed in Yellow House Canyon. However, the town of Lubbock was not founded until 1890, when it was formed from a unique&lt;/p&gt;

Davis played Maria Lucas in the BBC&#39;s 1995 production of Pride and Prejudice. She has also appeared in the film Sex Lives of the Potato Men (2004), had a role in Shaun of the Dead (2004), and played Hayley Jordan in The Archers on BBC Radio 4. She gave up the latter role when her other acting responsibilities made it impossible to continue; the part was recast in September 2005.
She was reportedly offered a role in In Her Shoes that eventually went to Toni Collette. Davis apparently refused the role as it involved being Cameron Diaz&#39;s on-screen &#39;fat, ugly&#39; sister. In 2006, Davis appeared as the &#39;Fashion TV&#39; host on ABC&#39;s hit Ugly Betty, and later that year was cast as a British comedy writer in NBC&#39;s Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip. In 2008, she began a recurring role on the US series Reaper. In 2010 Davis starred in ITV&#39;s six episode comedy drama, Married Single Other, and also appeared in a guest role in The Mentalist alongside her husband Owain Yeoman. Davis also stars in the John Landis-produced thriller Some Guy Who Kills&lt;/p&gt;

Lucy Liu was born and was raised with her brother John in Jackson Heights, Queens, New York, by Taiwanese immigrant parents. Liu has said that she grew up in a &quot;diverse&quot; neighborhood. Her family spoke Mandarin at home and she did not learn English until she was five years old. Her father, Tom, was a civil engineer, and her mother, Cecilia, a biochemist, but they sacrificed those careers in Taiwan to come to the United States. Liu, at her parents&#39; insistence, devoted her spare time to studying. She attended the Joseph Pulitzer Middle School (I.S.145) and she graduated from New York City&#39;s prestigious Stuyvesant High School in 1986. She attended New York University for one year, before transferring to the University of Michigan, where she joined the Chi Omega sorority and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Asian Languages and Cultures.

The population was 5,080 at the 2000 census. There is some debate as to how Luling got its name. Some say it was named for a Chinese railroad worker, others for a judge named Luling, or that it was the maiden name of a railroad builder&#39;s wife. It is part of the Greater Austin area.
Luling was founded in 1874 as a railroad town and became a rowdy center for the cattle drivers on the Chisholm Trail. Contempt of the law by the cowboys helped Luling become known as the &quot;toughest town in Texas.&quot; After the great cattle drives ended in the late 1880s, Luling quieted down to a town of about 500, where cotton ruled the local economy.
The single most important event in Luling&#39;s history was the discovery of oil by Edgar B. Davis. Davis had mortgaged everything he owned to finance drilling for oil around Luling. On August 9, 1922, The Rafael Rios No. 1 well came in at 2,161&amp;#160;feet (659&amp;#160;m) and produced 150&amp;#160;barrels per day (24&amp;#160;m/d). To repay his loans, Davis contracted 2&amp;#160;million barrels (320,000&amp;#160;m) at $.50 a barrel to Atlantic Oil and another 2 million to Magnolia Oil, plus another 2&amp;#160;million barrels (320,000&amp;#160;m)&lt;/p&gt;

Mace Windu is one of the earliest named and created characters in Star Wars history, being the narrator of the original 1973 drafts of the original Star Wars film (later named Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope). Through the process of redrafting and copyediting, his character was removed from the original film and its two successors, but he was reintroduced in 1994 when series creator George Lucas began writing the prequel trilogy.
When Lucas offered Samuel L. Jackson the role of Mace Windu, Jackson signed on, but with certain stipulations on the portrayal of his character. Aware that the climax of the prequel trilogy would eventually call for Mace Windu&#39;s death, one of the conditions was that his character die in a spectacular fashion, rather than ingloriously be killed off. 
Also, according to an interview on The Late Show with David Letterman on May 13, 2005, Windu&#39;s purple lightsaber was a personal request from Jackson to Lucas as a quid pro quo for appearing in the films, as well as a way of making the character unique and easily distinguishable.&lt;/p&gt;

The main island, also called Madagascar, is the fourth-largest island in the world, and is home to 5% of the world&#39;s plant and animal species, of which more than 80% are endemic to Madagascar. They include the lemur infraorder of primates, the carnivorous fossa, three bird families and six baobab species. Two-thirds of the population live below the international poverty line of US$1.25 a day.
As part of East Gondwana, the territory of Madagascar split from Africa approximately 160 million years ago; the island of Madagascar was created when it separated from the Indian subcontinent 80 to 100 million years ago. Malagasy mythology portrays a group of African pygmy like people called the Vazimba as the original inhabitants of Madagascar, however most archaeologists estimate that the human settlement of Madagascar happened between 200 and 500 A.D., when seafarers from southeast Asia (probably from Borneo or the southern Celebes) arrived in outrigger sailing canoes.

She was born as Edith Madeleine Carroll at 32 Herbert Street (now number 44) West Bromwich, England. She graduated from the University of Birmingham, England with a B.A. degree. She once taught in a girl&#39;s public school.
Widely recognized as one of the most beautiful women in films (she won a film beauty competition to start herself off in the business), Carroll&#39;s aristocratic blonde allure and sophisticated style were first glimpsed by British movie audiences in The Guns of Loos in 1928. Rapidly rising to stardom in England, she graced such popular films of the early &#39;30s as Young Woodley, Atlantic, The School for Scandal and I Was A Spy. She played the title role in the play Little Catherine. Abruptly, she announced plans to retire from films to devote herself to a private life with her husband, the first of four.
She attracted the attention of Alfred Hitchcock and, in 1935, starred as one of the director&#39;s earliest prototypical cool, glib, intelligent blondes in The 39 Steps based on the espionage novel by John Buchan. The film became a sensation and with it, so did&lt;/p&gt;

In the latter part of her career, she appeared in many Laurel and Hardy comedies, where she frequently played Hardy&#39;s shrewish wife.
Born in Melbourne, Australia, Busch was a member of a musical family. Her father was a conductor of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra and her mother was a singer. In 1900 her family moved to America, where she was placed in a convent. Upon her graduation Busch decided to pursue a career in theatre, and appeared on stage and then in vaudeville. She first appeared in films in The Agitator and The Water Nymph, both released in 1912. In 1915 she began working at Keystone Studios, where she appeared in comedy two-reelers. Her dalliance with studio chief Mack Sennett famously ended his engagement to actress Mabel Normand when Normand allegedly walked in on the pair. According to some accounts of the incident, Busch inflicted a serious head injury on Normand by striking her with a vase (she was known for pinpoint throwing accuracy).

Its population has grown rapidly over the past ten years to about 100,000 but, it is still one of the smallest capital cities in Africa.
The city was first founded by the British in 1827, who leased the island from Spain during the colonial period. Named Port Clarence, it was used as a naval station in the effort to suppress the slave trade. Many newly freed slaves were also settled there, prior to the establishment of Liberia as a colony for freed slaves. While many of them later relocated to Sierra Leone, some of their descendants, called Fernandinos, can still be found in Malabo and the surrounding area, where they constitute a distinct ethnic group, speaking their own Afro-Portuguese pidgin dialect.
When the island reverted to complete Spanish control, Malabo was renamed Santa Isabel. It was chosen to replace the mainland town of Bata as the capital of the country in 1969, and was renamed Malabo in 1973 as part of President Francisco Mac&amp;#237;as Nguema&#39;s campaign to replace European place&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Malcolm &quot;Mal&quot; Reynolds is a fictional character in the Firefly franchise. Reynolds is played by actor Nathan Fillion in the 2002 TV series Firefly and the 2005 film Serenity. In the series, Reynolds is the captain of the Firefly-class spaceship Serenity. The character was named #18 in TV Guide&#39;s &quot;Greatest Sci-fi legends&quot; list in 2004.
Conceived by Joss Whedon, the character Malcolm Reynolds was the only definite character he had in mind when formulating the ensemble cast. He wanted a hero, but not a hero in the classic sense; someone that is &quot;everything that a hero is not.&quot;
In the proposed pilot, Mal was much darker and considerably more closed-off. FOX network executives objected, and asked that Mal be &quot;lightened up&quot;. For the second episode (&quot;The Train Job&quot;), Whedon created a more &quot;jolly&quot; Mal Reynolds.
The role was originally written for Buffy the Vampire Slayer co-star Nicholas Brendon; however, the shooting schedule conflicted with his commitment to Buffy.
Whedon approached Nathan Fillion to play the lead, and after explaining the premise and showing Fillion the treatment for the pilot, Fillion was eager for the role. Fillion was called back several times to read for the part&lt;/p&gt;

Its size is just over 1,240,000&amp;#160;km&amp;#178; with a population more than 14 million. Its capital is Bamako. Mali consists of eight regions and its borders on the north reach deep into the middle of the Sahara, while the country&#39;s southern region, where the majority of inhabitants live, features the Niger and S&amp;#233;n&amp;#233;gal rivers. The country&#39;s economic structure centers around agriculture and fishing. Some of Mali&#39;s natural resources include gold, uranium, and salt. Mali is considered to be one of the poorest nations in the world.
Present-day Mali was once part of three West African empires that controlled trans-Saharan trade: the Ghana Empire, the Mali Empire (from which Mali is named), and the Songhai Empire. In the late 1800s, Mali fell under French control, becoming part of French Sudan. Mali gained independence in 1959 with Senegal, as the Mali Federation. A year later, the Mali Federation became the independent&lt;/p&gt;

Malta covers just over 300&amp;#160;km&amp;#178; in land area, making it one of Europe&#39;s smallest and one of Europe&#39;s most densely populated countries. Its de facto capital is Valletta and the largest city is Birkirkara. Maltese is the national language and a co-official language, alongside English.
Throughout history, Malta&#39;s location has given it great strategic importance and a sequence of powers including the Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Fatimids, Sicilians, Knights of St John, French and the British have all ruled the islands.

It is also the largest city in Nicaragua. Located on the southwestern shore of Lake Managua, the city was declared the national capital in 1852. Previously, the capital had alternated between the cities of Le&amp;#243;n and Granada. The city has a population of roughly 1,800,000, composed predominantly of mestizos and whites; making it the second most populous city in Central America after Guatemala City.
Founded in 1819, the city was given the name: Leal Villa de Santiago de Managua. Its original purpose was to serve as a rural fishing village. Efforts to make Managua the capital of Nicaragua began in 1824, after the Central American nations formally attained their independence from Spain. Managua&#39;s location between the rival cities of Le&amp;#243;n and Granada made it a logical and ideal compromise site. Managua&#39;s economy is based mainly on trade. The city is Nicaragua&#39;s chief trading center for coffee, cotton, and other crops. It is also an important industrial center. Its chief products include beer, coffee, matches, textiles, and shoes.

Evans was born in 1963 in Carmarthen, Wales. He studied for a history of art degree at the University of Cambridge, and then took a year out before taking a one-year course in film at the University of Bristol, where his contemporaries included Michael Winterbottom.
Evans worked as a runner for a commercials company in London, before cutting his teeth on TV drama, starting out with Welsh-medium productions for S4C, and latterly including episodes of The Ruth Rendell Mysteries.
He then transferred to film, with 1997&#39;s House of America about a young Welsh immigrant to the United States who falls foul of the American dream. In 1998 came controversy with Resurrection Man, a thriller set amid sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.
His first box office hit was the Big Brother-inspired horror film My Little Eye. In 2004 he directed Trauma starring Colin Firth and Mena Suvari, written by Richard Smith, which reprised the darker elements of My Little Eye via a chilling psychological study of amnesia and despair.

Platt (born Marcel LePlat) was trained by the influential teacher Mary Ann Wells (Anawalt 44n). His professional career began in earnest when he was hired as one of the original members of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo; along with other non-Russian company members like Betty Low, he performed under a faux-Russian name (Platoff). While with the company, Platt choreographed Ghost Town (1939), set to music by Richard Rodgers. In 2000, he was presented with the Nijinski Award at the Ballets Russes Reunion.
Platt&#39;s most notable musical theatre role was Dream Curly in the original 1943 Broadway production of Oklahoma!. (He danced the opening night performance on an injured foot, courtesy of the overly-enthusiastic fight sequences with his Dream Jud, George Church.) Agnes de Mille later gave him a cameo role in the 1955 movie version. Although none of Platt&#39;s other Broadway appearances were in successful shows, he toured as Bill Calhoun/Lucentio in Kiss Me, Kate.
On film, Platt&#39;s best-known role is that of &quot;Daniel Pontipee,&quot; the fourth-oldest brother in&lt;/p&gt;

She was born in Tokyo, Japan, and started work as a singer from a very young age, her specialty being jazz and a level of sensuality that was somewhat shocking in a Japan as conservative as it was at the time. Her movements, even while singing, are smooth, graceful and have a trademark undulating of the hand at the audience which, with a simple imitation, can bring only her to mind.
Natsuki further shocked the Japanese audiences by appearing fully nude in the Fukasaku Kinji movie Satomi Hakkenden (Legend of the Eight Samurai) in 1983.
Despite her explicit and desirable femininity, Natsuki concentrated all her energy into her art and shunned traditional values of becoming the homemaker or quitting her job after a certain age. Thus, she never married, which made her quite an icon for what is called a Kakkoii Onna, or &quot;classy woman&quot; in modern Japan today. But to the surprise of all, on the 18th of October 2007 she announced that she was engaged to marry percussionist Nobu Saito in spring 2008.
Today she continues to work as a singer and&lt;/p&gt;

As of the 2000 census, the city had a total population of 58,748, making it one of metro Atlanta&#39;s largest suburbs. Census estimates of 2007 indicate a population of 67,021. Marietta is the third-largest of three principal cities (by population) of and is included in the Atlanta&amp;#8211;Sandy Springs&amp;#8211;Marietta, Georgia, metropolitan statistical area, which is included in the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Gainesville, Georgia-Alabama (part) combined statistical area.
Homes had been built by early settlers near the Cherokee town of Big Shanty (now Kennesaw) by 1824.
In 1837, the Georgia Gazetteer reported that the city of Marietta was named for Mary Cobb, the wife of U.S. Senator and U.S. Supreme Court Judge Thomas Willis Cobb. The first plat was laid out in 1833. Like most towns, Marietta had a square in the center with a courthouse. The Georgia General Assembly legally recognized the town on December 19, 1834.
Marietta was selected as the home base for the new Western and Atlantic Railroad, and business boomed.

After spending much of her childhood in foster homes, Monroe began a career as a model, which led to a film contract in 1946. Her early film appearances were minor, but her performances in The Asphalt Jungle and All About Eve (both 1950) were critically acclaimed. In a few years, Monroe reached stardom and was cast as the leading lady in such films as Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, How to Marry a Millionaire, Some Like It Hot, and The Seven Year Itch.
The typecasting of Monroe&#39;s &quot;dumb blonde&quot; persona limited her career prospects, so she broadened her range. She studied at the Actors Studio and formed Marilyn Monroe Productions. Her dramatic performance in Bus Stop was hailed by critics, and she won a Golden Globe Award for Some Like it Hot.
The final years of Monroe&#39;s life were marked by illness, personal problems, and a reputation for being unreliable and difficult to work with. The circumstances of her death, from an overdose of barbiturates, have been the subject of conjecture. Though officially classified as a &quot;probable suicide,&quot; the&lt;/p&gt;

This nation of roughly 62,000 people is located north of Nauru and Kiribati, east of the Federated States of Micronesia, and south of the U.S. territory of Wake Island, to which it lays claim. In 1986 independence was attained under a Compact of Free Association with the United States.
Although the Marshall Islands were settled by Micronesians in the 2nd millennium BC, little is known of their early history. People traveled by canoe between islands using traditional stick charts.
Spanish explorer Alonso de Salazar was the first European to see the islands in 1526, but they remained virtually unvisited by Europeans until the arrival of British Captain John Charles Marshall in 1788. The islands were named after him in the British maps. However, they were claimed under the Spanish sovereignty as part of the Spanish Oceania. In 1874 the Spanish sovereignty was recognized by the international community. They were sold to Germany&lt;/p&gt;

Created by writer Stan Lee and artist John Romita, Sr., after a few partial appearances and references, her first full appearance was in The Amazing Spider-Man #42 (November 1966).
Mary Jane is depicted as an extremely beautiful, green-eyed redhead, and has been the primary romantic interest of Peter Parker for the last twenty years, although initially competing with others for his affection, most prominently with Gwen Stacy and the Black Cat. Mary Jane&#39;s relatively unknown early life was eventually explored in Amazing Spider-Man&#39; #259.
Early issues of Amazing Spider-Man featured a running joke about Peter dodging his Aunt May&#39;s attempts to set him up with &quot;that nice Watson girl next door&quot;, whom Peter had not yet met and assumed would not be his type, since his aunt liked her.

Marylebone is in an area of London that can be roughly defined as the area bounded by Oxford Street to the south, Marylebone Road to the north, Edgware Road to the west and Great Portland Street to the east . Occasionally, this area is designated as &quot;Marylebone Village&quot;. A broader definition of Marylebone is then used, which encompasses Regent&#39;s Park, Baker Street and the area immediately north of Marylebone Road, containing Marylebone Station, the original site of the Marylebone Cricket Club at Dorset Square, and the neighbourhood known as Lisson Grove to the border with St John&#39;s Wood. The west side of the Fitzrovia area up to Cleveland Street was also previously considered to be part of Marylebone.
Today the area is mostly residential, with many medical and dental offices in its central area. Since the opening of the Jubilee Line at Baker Street station (with its direct links to Canary Wharf), Marylebone - particularly Marylebone Village - has become a very sought-after area of Central&lt;/p&gt;

Located on the Caledon River, bordering South Africa, Maseru is Lesotho&#39;s only sizable city, with a population of approximately 227,880 (2006). The city was established as a police camp and assigned as the capital after the country became a British protectorate in 1869. When the country achieved independence in 1966, Maseru retained its status as capital. The name of the city is a Sesotho word meaning &quot;place of the red sandstone&quot;.
Maseru was founded by the British as a small police camp in 1869, following the conclusion of the Free State-Basotho Wars when Basutoland became a British protectorate. Maseru is located at the edge of the &quot;conquered territories&quot; relinquished to the Orange Free State (now the Free State province of South Africa) as part of the peace terms.

Mattox was a proteg&amp;#233; of the legendary jazz dance pioneer Jack Cole, with whom he worked on Broadway in Magdalena (1948). His other Broadway credits include Harry Beaton in the 1957 revival of Brigadoon. Mattox also performed concert engagements with his own dance company. His brief career as a Broadway choreographer included Jennie and Say, Darling. &amp;#8226;	Matt Mattox took the fluid, animalistic style of Jack Cole and merged it with his own vast background in ballet technique to create a technique for jazz dance that is clean, powerful, and extremely challenging. His jazz class is assembled in the progression of a ballet class, and he calls his exercises &quot;the barre.&quot; Mattox also has specifically designed the exercises to relate to the combinations given at the end of his class. The positions, shapes, and qualities developed during the barre are visible within his own detailed and polished style. However, Mattox had a higher profile as a specialty dancer in Hollywood musicals. His best-known film role is Caleb Pontipee in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, but he was also a principal dancer in, among others,&lt;/p&gt;

O&#39;Hara was born Maureen FitzSimons on the Lower Churchtown Rd in the Dublin suburb of Churchtown, Dublin 14, Ireland. She was the second oldest of six children by Charles Stewart Parnell FitzSimons and Marguerita Lilburn FitzSimons.

Her mother, a former operatic contralto, was a successful womans&#39; clothier. Her siblings were Peggy, the oldest, and younger Charles, Florrie, Margot and Jimmy. Peggy dedicated her life to a religious order, Sisters of Charity, and the younger children all went on to receive training at the Abbey Theater and the Ena Mary Burke School of Drama and Elocution in Dublin. O&#39;Hara&#39;s dream at that time was to be an opera singer like her mother.
O&#39;Hara&#39;s father was a very practical man and did not entirely support her theatrical aspirations. He insisted she learn a skill so&lt;/p&gt;

It is located on the Mbabane River and its tributary the Polinjane River in the Mdimba Mountains. It is located in the district of Hhohho, of which it is also the capital. The average elevation of the city is 3,800 ft. The population (estimated) in 1987 was 30,000.
The town grew after the nation&#39;s administrative centre moved from Bremersdorp (now called Manzini) in 1902. It derives its name from a Chief, Mbabane Kunene, who lived in the area when British settlers arrived. It is also a commercial hub for the surrounding region, while tin and iron were mined nearby.
Mbabane&#39;s closest border crossing to South Africa is Ngwenya-Oshoek, and though siSwati is the primary language, English is widespread. Mbabane, and Swaziland itself, depend on tourism and sugar exports. The city has two sites for light industries.

The city is located on the 4 Chickasaw Bluff, south of the confluence of the Wolf and Mississippi rivers.
Memphis has an estimated population of 670,100 making it the largest city in the state of Tennessee, the third largest in the Southeastern United States, and the 19th largest in the United States. The greater Memphis metropolitan area, including adjacent counties in Mississippi and Arkansas, has a population of 1,280,533. This makes Memphis the second largest metropolitan area in Tennessee, surpassed only by metropolitan Nashville, which overtook Memphis in recent years. Memphis is the youngest of Tennessee&#39;s four major cities (traditionally including Knoxville, Chattanooga, and Nashville). A resident of Memphis is referred to as a Memphian and the Memphis region is known, particularly to media outlets, as the &quot;Mid-South.&quot;
Because it occupies a substantial bluff rising from the Mississippi river bank, the area is a natural location for settlement. The Memphis area was first settled by the Mississippian Culture and then by the Chickasaw Indian tribe. For 10,000 years&lt;/p&gt;

It is the current seat of the Powers of the Union but the Mexican federal Congress, which is controlled by the 31 free and sovereign Mexican States, can change the location of such seat if it desires to do so. Mexico City is also known as the Federal District (Distrito Federal), a federal entity within Mexico which is not part of any one of the 31 Mexican states in particular. Instead, it belongs to the federation as a whole. It is the most important political center in the country. Mexico City is also considered one of the most important financial centers in Latin America. Supporters of this view point out that the market capitalization of the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, Mexico&#39;s main stock exchange, is greater than the combined market capitalization of the main stock exchanges of Argentina, Chile, and Peru. It is also considered a global city. Located in the Valley of Mexico, a large valley in the high plateaus at the center of Mexico, at an altitude of 2,240&amp;#160;metres (7,350&amp;#160;ft), the city consists of sixteen boroughs.

It is bordered on the north by the United States; on the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; on the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and on the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost 2 million square kilometres (over 760,000&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi), Mexico is the fifth-largest country in the Americas by total area and the 14th largest independent nation in the world.

Mexico is a federation comprising thirty-one states and a Federal District, the capital city.
In Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica many cultures matured into advanced civilizations such as the Olmec, the Toltec, the Teotihuacan, the Zapotec, the Maya and the Aztec before the first contact with Europeans. In 1521, Spain conquered and colonized the territory, which was administered as the viceroyalty of New Spain which would eventually become Mexico as the colony gained independence in&lt;/p&gt;

Miyagi Prefecture was formerly part of the province of Mutsu. Mutsu Province, on northern Honsh&amp;#363;, was one of the last provinces to be formed as land was taken from the indigenous Ainu and became the largest as it expanded northward. The ancient capital was in modern Miyagi Prefecture.
In the 3rd month of 2nd year of the Wad&amp;#333; era (709), there was an uprising against governmental authority in Mutsu Province and in nearby Echigo Province. Troops were promptly dispatched to subdue the revolt.
In Wad&amp;#333; 5 (712), the land of Mutsu Province was administratively separated from Dewa Province. Empress Gemmei&#39;s Daij&amp;#333;-kan continued to organize other cadastral changes in the provincial map of the Nara period, as in the following year when Mimasaka Province was divided from Bizen Province; Hy&amp;#363;ga Province was sundered from Osumi Province; and Tamba Province was severed from Tango Province.
During the Sengoku period various clans ruled different parts of the province. The Uesugi clan had a castle town at Wakamatsu in the south, the Nambu clan at Morioka in the north, and&lt;/p&gt;

Located in the coastal Benadir region on the Indian Ocean, the city has served as an important port for centuries.
According to the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, maritime trade connected Somalis in the Mogadishu area with other communities along the Indian Ocean coast as early as the 1st century CE. With Muslim traders from the Arabian Peninsula arriving circa 900 CE, Mogadishu was well-suited to become a regional center for commerce.
The name &quot;Mogadishu&quot; is held to be derived from the Arabic &amp;#1605;&amp;#1602;&amp;#1593;&amp;#1583; &amp;#1588;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1607; Maq&#39;ad Shah (&quot;The seat of the Shah&quot;), a reflection of the city&#39;s early Persian influence.

Following his visit to the city, the twelfth century Syrian historian Yaqut al-Hamawi wrote that it was inhabited by dark-skinned Berbers, the ancestors of the modern Somalis.

Montevideo is situated on the south coast of Uruguay, along the Atlantic Ocean. The geographic coordinates are 34.5&amp;#176; S, 56&amp;#176;W. Despite the average elevation of 43&amp;#160;m (141 ft), Montevideo has extensive beaches and seaport areas at the waterfront.

In spite of its excellent location, the city of Montevideo was established in 1726, mainly as a base to defend the eastern province of Virreinato del R&amp;#237;o de la Plata from Portuguese incursions.

First portrayed by James Doohan in the original Star Trek series, Scotty also appears in the animated Star Trek series, seven Star Trek movies, the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode &quot;Relics&quot;, and in numerous books, comics, and video games. Simon Pegg assumed the character for the 2009 film Star Trek.
Doohan was cast as the Enterprise engineer for the second Star Trek pilot, &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; (1966) on the recommendation of that episode&#39;s director, James Goldstone, who had worked with him before. The character almost didn&#39;t make it to the show after series creator Gene Roddenberry sent Doohan a letter informing him, &quot;We don&#39;t think we need an engineer in the series&quot;; only the intervention of Doohan&#39;s agent meant that the character could remain. He tried a variety of accents for the part, and decided to use a Scottish accent on the basis that he thought Scottish people make the best engineers. Doohan himself chose Scotty&#39;s first name of Montgomery in honor of his maternal grandfather, James Montgomery.
Paul McGillion auditioned for the Scotty role for the 2009 Star Trek&lt;/p&gt;

It measures approximately 16&amp;#160;km (10 miles) long and 11&amp;#160;km (7 miles) wide, giving 40&amp;#160;kilometres (25&amp;#160;mi) of coastline. Christopher Columbus gave Montserrat its name on his second voyage to the New World in 1493, after Montserrat mountain located in Catalonia, Spain. Montserrat is nicknamed the Emerald Isle of the Caribbean, both for its resemblance to coastal Ireland and for the Irish descent of its inhabitants.
Its Georgian era capital city of Plymouth was destroyed and two-thirds of the island&#39;s population were forced to flee abroad by an eruption of the previously dormant Soufriere Hills volcano that began on July 18, 1995. The eruption continues today on a much reduced scale, the damage being confined to the areas around Plymouth including its docking facilities and the former W.H. Bramble Airport. An exclusion zone extending from the south coast of the island north to parts of the Belham Valley has been imposed because of an increase in the size of the existing volcanic dome.

It has been dubbed the &quot;Bathtub Racing Capital of the World&quot; and &quot;Harbour City&quot;. Nanaimo is also sometimes referred to as the &quot;Hub City&quot; because of its central location on Vancouver Island and due to the layout of the downtown streets which form a &quot;hub&quot; pattern. It is also fondly known as the &quot;Hub, Tub, and Pub City&quot; because of its association with the bathtub racing and the numerous &quot;watering holes&quot; in Old Nanaimo. It is the seat of the Regional District of Nanaimo.
The first Europeans to find Nanaimo Bay were those of the 1791 Spanish voyage of Juan Carrasco, under the command of Francisco de Eliza. They gave it the name Bocas de Winthuysen.
Nanaimo began as a trading post in the early 1800s; in 1849 the Snuneymuxw chief Ki-et-sa-kun (&quot;Coal Tyee&quot;) informed the Hudson&#39;s Bay Company of the presence of coal in the area, and in 1853 the company built a fort known as the Nanaimo Bastion (still preserved). Subsequently the town was chiefly known for the export of coal.
Robert Dunsmuir helped establish coal mines in the Nanaimo harbour area&lt;/p&gt;

Spungen has been the subject of controversy among music historians and fans of the Sex Pistols.
Spungen was born at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Frank and Deborah Spungen. She was born with severe cyanosis, and nearly died of brain damage after being choked by her umbilical cord during delivery. The doctors successfully secured a blood transfusion which healed her brain damage, and she was released from the hospital eight days after birth. The Spungen family was a middle class Jewish family who resided in Lower Moreland Township, a suburb of Philadelphia. Her father was a traveling salesman, and her mother owned an organic food store called The Earth Shop in nearby Jenkintown, Pennsylvania.
She was a difficult baby, throwing crying fits and temper tantrums late into childhood. At three months old, she was administered a liquid barbiturate by a pediatrician, but her violent behavior persisted. In an interview, Deborah Spungen stated, &quot;I know it&#39;s normal for babies to scream, but Nancy did nothing but scream.&quot;

As of the 2000 census, Nashua had a total population of 86,605, making it the second largest city in the state (and in the three northern New England states) after Manchester (pop. 107,219). The estimated population of Nashua in 2007 was 87,150.
Built around the now-departed textile industry, in recent decades it has been swept up in southern New Hampshire&#39;s economic expansion as part of the Boston region. Nashua was twice named &quot;Best Place to Live in America&quot; in annual surveys by Money magazine. It is the only city to get the No. 1 ranking two times&amp;#8212;in 1987 and 1997. In 2007, the Morgan Quitno Press ranked Nashua as the 27th safest city in the country.
The area was part of a 200-square-mile (520&amp;#160;km) tract of land in Massachusetts called Dunstable, which had been awarded to Edward Tyng of Dunstable, England. Nashua lies approximately in the center of the original 1673 grant. When New Hampshire separated from Massachusetts in 1741, the state line between them was redrawn. As a consequence, the township of Dunstable was divided in two. Tyngsboro and some of Dunstable remained in Massachusetts, while Dunstable, New Hampshire&lt;/p&gt;

The city has a population of 260,000 (2008 census), nearly 80 percent of the entire population of The Bahamas (330,000). Lynden Pindling International Airport, the major airport for The Bahamas, is located about 16&amp;#160;kilometres (9.9&amp;#160;mi) west of Nassau city centre, and has daily flights to major cities in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada and the Caribbean. The city is located on the island of New Providence, which functions much like a federal district. While there is no local government, it is governed directly as an administrative division of the national government. Nassau is considered a historical stronghold of pirates.
Nassau&#39;s modern growth began just over 200 years ago with the influx of thousands of American Loyalists and enslaved Africans to The Bahamas following the American War of Independence. Many of them settled in Nassau (the then and still commerce capital of The Bahamas) and eventually came to outnumber the original inhabitants.
As the population of Nassau grew, so did the built-up areas. Today the city dominates the entire island and its satellite, Paradise&lt;/p&gt;

Settled by Micronesian and Polynesian people, Nauru was annexed and claimed as a colony by the German Empire in the late 19th century. After World War I, Nauru became a League of Nations mandate administered by Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. During World War II, Nauru was occupied by Japanese troops who were bypassed by the Allied advance across the Pacific, and after the war ended, it entered into trusteeship again. Nauru was declared independent in 1968.

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Ned Thomas Beatty (born July 6, 1937) is an American actor. He currently resides (as of 2010) near Springville, California. The Beattys also vacation to the small town of Karlstad, Minnesota where the couple owns a small residence.
Beatty was born in Louisville, Kentucky, the son of Margaret Fortney (n&amp;#233;e Lennis) and Charles William Beatty. He has a sister, Mary Margaret, and a brother. In 1947, Beatty began singing in gospel and barbershop quartets, in St. Matthews, Kentucky, as well as at his local church. He made his stage debut at age 19, appearing in Wilderness Road, an outdoor-historical pageant located in Berea, Kentucky. He attended college at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky, although he didn&#39;t graduate. Beatty worked in the Louisville area through the mid-1960s, at the Clarksville Little Theater (IN) and the recently founded Actors Theater of Louisville. His time at the latter included a run as Willy Loman in Arthur Miller&#39;s Death of a Salesman, in 1966.
Beatty has appeared in more than 100 films, but is perhaps best-remembered for his role as an insecure, timid overweight man who is humiliated, dominated and then sodomized in his debut film, Deliverance&lt;/p&gt;

It is covered by London post town and the SE14 postcode district. New Cross is near St Johns, New Cross Gate, Telegraph Hill, Nunhead, Peckham, Brockley, Deptford and Greenwich.
It is home to Goldsmiths, University of London, of Haberdashers&#39; Aske&#39;s Hatcham College and of Addey and Stanhope School.
New Cross was originally founded by local jester Adam Soffe and was formerly known as Hatcham (the name persists in the title of the Anglican parishes of St. James, Hatcham along with its school, and All Saints, Hatcham Park). The earliest reference to Hatcham is in the 11th century, in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Hacheham. It was held by the Bishop of Lisieux from the Bishop of Bayeux. Its domesday assets were: 3 hides; 3 ploughs, 6&amp;#160;acres (24,000&amp;#160;m) of meadow, woodland worth 3 hogs. It rendered &amp;#163;2.
Hatcham tithes were paid to Bermondsey Abbey from 1173 until the dissolution of the monasteries when the Crown took over. A series of individuals then held land locally before the manor was bought in the 17th century by the Haberdashers&#39; Company, a&lt;/p&gt;

It is situated within the metropolis of Delhi and serves as the seat of the Government of India and the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi.
New Delhi is one of the nine districts of Delhi. The foundation of the city was laid on December 15, 1911, and was planned by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker, leading 20th century British architects. Inaugurated on February 13, 1931 by Viceroy, Lord Irwin, the city is known for its wide, tree-lined boulevards and is home to numerous national institutions and landmarks. The total area of the city is 42.7 km. 
New Delhi was laid out to the south of the Old City which was constructed by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. However, New Delhi overlays the site of seven ancient cities and hence includes many historic monuments like the Jantar Mantar and the Lodhi Gardens.
Calcutta was the capital of India until December 1911 during the British Raj. However, Delhi had served as the political and financial centre of several empires of ancient and medieval India, most notably of the Mughal Empire from 1799 to 1849. During the early 1900s, a proposal was made&lt;/p&gt;

The indigenous M&amp;#257;ori language name for New Zealand is Aotearoa, commonly translated as The Land of the Long White Cloud. The Realm of New Zealand also includes the Cook Islands and Niue (self-governing but in free association); Tokelau; and the Ross Dependency (New Zealand&#39;s territorial claim in Antarctica).
New Zealand is notable for its geographic isolation: it is situated about 2,000&amp;#160;km (1250 miles) southeast of Australia across the Tasman Sea, and its closest neighbours to the north are New Caledonia, Fiji and Tonga. During its long isolation New Zealand developed a distinctive fauna dominated by birds, a number of which became extinct after the arrival of humans and the mammals they introduced.
The majority of New Zealand&#39;s population is of European descent; the indigenous M&amp;#257;ori are the largest minority. Asians and non-M&amp;#257;ori Polynesians are also significant minority groups, especially in urban areas. The most commonly spoken language is English.

Newton does not have a single city center, but is rather a patchwork of 13 &quot;villages&quot;, many boasting small &quot;downtown&quot; areas of their own. The 13 villages are: Auburndale, Chestnut Hill, Newton Centre, Newton Corner, Newton Highlands, Newton Lower Falls, Newton Upper Falls (both on the Charles River, and both once small industrial sites), Newtonville, Nonantum (also called &quot;The Lake&quot;), Oak Hill, Thompsonville, Waban, and West Newton. Oak Hill Park is a place within the village of Oak Hill that itself is shown as a separate and distinct village on some city maps, (including a map dated 2010 on the official City of Newton website) and Four Corners is also shown as a village on some city maps. Although most of the villages have a post office, they have no legal definition and no firmly defined borders. This village-based system often causes some confusion with addresses and for first time visitors.
Newton was settled in 1630 as part of &quot;the newe towne&quot;, which was renamed Cambridge in 1638.&lt;/p&gt;

Ng has worked with famous actor and director Stephen Chow in a series of &quot;mo lei tau&quot; movies (&quot;mo lei tau&quot; translates to &quot;brainless&quot;/&quot;senseless or random,&quot; and it is a genre of slapstick comedy unique to Hong Kong). Ng co-starred with Stephen Chow in a Hong Kong TVB television series called Dun Fei Final Combat (&amp;#33995;&amp;#19990;&amp;#35946;&amp;#20448;) (1989), and also the popular 1990 film All for the Winner, where he played the role of Chow&#39;s uncle. From then on, the two would grow to star in many more &quot;mo lei tau&quot; films in the same style as All for the Winner.
Although Ng Man Tat owes much of his popularity from co-starring with Chow in &quot;mo lei tau&quot; films, he has shown to be a versatile enough actor to successfully portray various different roles. A perfect example of his talent is in his portrayal of Sister 13&#39;s father in Portland Street Blues, where he played a man who could not feel anything but abuse and rejection. This role proved to be the perfect complement to his usual &quot;mo lei tau&quot; style with&lt;/p&gt;

It is Niger&#39;s largest city, lying on the Niger River, mostly on the east bank. It is an administrative, cultural and economic center. Niamey&#39;s population, officially 774,235 at the 2006 census, is estimated much higher. Niamey is located at 13&amp;#176;31&#39;17&quot; North, 2&amp;#176;6&#39;19&quot; East (13.521389, 2.105278).
The city is located in a pearl millet growing region, while manufacturing industries include bricks, ceramic goods, cement and weaving.
Niamey was probably founded in the eighteenth century, but was of little importance to most of the country until the French developed a colonial post in the 1890s. This rapidly grew into an important center. In 1926 it became the capital of Niger, and the population gradually increased, from about 3,000 in 1930 to around 30,000 in 1960, 250,000 in 1980 and - by some estimates - 800,000 in 2000. The major cause of the increase has been immigration during droughts.
Covering an area of over 250&amp;#160;km&amp;#178; the metropolitan area sits atop two plateaus reaching 218 m in altitude, bisected by the Niger River. At Niamey, the river, running almost straight SSE from Gao, Mali, makes a&lt;/p&gt;

It borders Nigeria and Benin to the south, Burkina Faso and Mali to the west, Algeria and Libya to the north and Chad to the east. Niger covers a land area of almost 1,270,000&amp;#160;km, over 80 percent of which is covered by the Sahara desert. The country&#39;s predominantly Islamic population of just above 15,000,000 is mostly clustered in the far south and west of the nation. The capital city is Niamey.
Niger is a developing country. Much of the non-desert portions of the country are threatened by periodic drought and desertification. The economy is concentrated around subsistence and some export agriculture clustered in the more fertile south, and the export of raw materials&amp;#8212;especially uranium ore. Niger remains handicapped by its landlocked position, desert terrain, poor education and poverty of its people, lack of infrastructure, poor health care, and environmental degradation.
Nigerien society reflects a great diversity drawn from the long independent histories of its several ethnic groups and regions&lt;/p&gt;

The country is located in West Africa and shares land borders with the Republic of Benin in the west, Chad and Cameroon in the east, and Niger in the north. Its coast in the south lies on the Gulf of Guinea on the Atlantic Ocean. The three largest and most influential ethnic groups in Nigeria are the Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba. In terms of religion Nigeria is roughly split half and half between Muslims and Christians with a very small minority who practice traditional religions.
The people of Nigeria have an extensive history. Archaeological evidence shows that human habitation of the area dates back to at least 9000 BC. The area around the Benue and Cross River is thought to be the original homeland of the Bantu migrants who spread across most of central and southern Africa in waves between the 1st millennium BC and the 2nd millennium.
The name Nigeria was taken from the Niger River running through the country. This name was coined by Flora Shaw, the future wife of Baron Lugard, a British colonial&lt;/p&gt;

Its official name is Municipality of Norristown, though it was formerly a borough operating under Pennsylvania&#39;s Borough Code and is frequently referred to as &quot;the borough&quot; even in statements by its officials. However, since 1986, Norristown has been governed under home rule charters, not under Pennsylvania&#39;s Borough Code. The 1986 charter was properly forwarded to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for inclusion in the Pennsylvania Code. The succeeding 2004 home rule charter has not been so published, but may be read at the municipal website.

The Amnok River and the Tumen River form the border between North Korea and People&#39;s Republic of China. A section of the Tumen River in the extreme north-east is the border with Russia.
The peninsula was governed by the Korean Empire until it was annexed by Japan following the Russo-Japanese War of 1905. It was divided into Soviet and American occupied zones in 1945, following the end of World War II. North Korea refused to participate in a United Nations&amp;#8211;supervised election held in the south in 1948, which led to the creation of separate Korean governments for the two occupation zones. Both North and South Korea claimed sovereignty over the peninsula as a whole, which led to the Korean War of 1950. A 1953 armistice ended the fighting; however, the two countries are officially still at war with each other, as a peace treaty was never signed. Both states were accepted into the&lt;/p&gt;

Oakland is a major hub city for the Bay Area subregion collectively called the East Bay, and it is the county seat of Alameda County. Based on United States Census Bureau estimates for 2008, Oakland is the 44th-largest city in the USA with a population of 404,155.
The area was inhabited by the Ohlone people for thousands of years before Spanish settlers displaced them in the 18th and 19th centuries. Spain expanded the Viceroyalty of New Spain and colonized Alta California to stop the advancement of Russia from Alaska. Much of the land that was to become Oakland was held by the Peralta family under the Rancho San Antonio (Peralta) land grant. New Spain became independent in 1821 under the name &quot;Mexico.&quot; In 1846, the Territory of Alta California was conquered by American forces, becoming simply &quot;California.&quot; Throughout the 1840s and 1850s, American squatters laid legal claim to the land held by the Peralta family, and in 1852 the California legislature incorporated the&lt;/p&gt;

As of the 2000 census, the city had a total population of 21,910. A July 2007 estimate puts the population at 27,061. The city center is located approximately two miles east of the intersection of Interstate 64 and U.S. Route 50.
Founded in 1854, O&#39;Fallon&#39;s namesake comes from Colonel John O&#39;Fallon who was a wealthy gentleman from St. Louis. In downtown O&#39;Fallon, a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad railroad depot was built, which helped put O&#39;Fallon on the map. City lots were platted and sold at a public auction on May 18, 1854. A post office was established the following year and the city began attracting German settlers looking for fertile farming land. On January 27, 1874, O&#39;Fallon was incorporated as a village. On March 14, 1905, the citizens voted for a change to the city form of government. Since its founding, O&#39;Fallon has gained population every year except 1930, when the census showed a net loss of 23 people.
Since the 1980s, growth in O&#39;Fallon has accelerated. Following the expansion of Interstate 64, the 1990s saw a building boom with the construction of several now-established subdivisions including&lt;/p&gt;

Oldham is surrounded by several smaller settlements which together form the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, of which Oldham is the administrative centre.
Historically a part of Lancashire, and with little early history to speak of, Oldham rose to prominence during the 19th century as an international centre of textile manufacture. It was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution, and amongst the first ever industrialised towns, rapidly becoming &quot;one of the most important centres of cotton and textile industries in England&quot;. At its zenith, it was the most productive cotton spinning mill town in the world, spinning more cotton than France and Germany combined. Oldham&#39;s textile industry began to fall into decline during the mid-20th century, and its last mill closed in 1998.
The demise of textile processing in Oldham depressed the local economy. Today Oldham is a predominantly residential town, and a centre for further education and the&lt;/p&gt;

His father, Oliver, was a Confederate veteran wounded at the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862. After his demobilization as a recruiting officer for Company K, 16th Georgia Regiment, the elder Oliver Hardy assisted his father in running the vestiges of the family cotton plantation, bought a share in a retail business and was elected full-time Tax Collector for Columbia County. His mother, Emily Norvell, the daughter of Thomas Benjamin Norvell and Mary Freeman, was descended from Captain Hugh Norvell of Williamsburg, Virginia. Her family arrived in Virginia before 1635. Their marriage took place on March 12, 1890; it was the second marriage for the widow Emily, and the third for Oliver.
The family moved to Madison in 1891, before Norvell&amp;#8217;s birth. Norvell&amp;#8217;s mother owned a house in Harlem, which was either empty or tenanted by her mother. It is probable that Norvell was born in Harlem, though some sources say it was in his mother&amp;#8217;s home&lt;/p&gt;

As generally defined, Olney had a total population of 31,438 in the 2000 census.

Originally known as Mechanicsville, the village which became Olney was established in 1800. The area was mostly farmland, but it soon began attracting artisans. Early residents Sarah Brooke and Dr. Charles Farquhar were devotees of the English poet William Cowper, and named their home after the poet&#39;s hometown. The area was in turn named for their home, which still stands and is known as the Olney House.

In 1346 the old Prussian Warmian forest in the vicinity was cleared and a place was selected on the Alle now &amp;#321;yna River for a new settlement. It became known to Polish settlers as Olsztyn. The Teutonic Knights began construction of Ordensburg castle in 1347 to protect against the Old Prussians, and the settlement of Allenstein was first mentioned the following year. The German name Allenstein meant a castle on the Alle River. The settlement received municipal rights from Johannes von Leysen on 31 October 1353, and the castle was completed in 1397. Allenstein was incorporated into the Kingdom of Poland during the Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War in 1410 and in 1414 during the Hunger War, but was returned to the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights after hostilities ended.

Homolka&#39;s strong accent, stocky appearance, bushy eyebrows and Slavic-sounding name led many to believe he was Eastern European or Russian, but he was born in Vienna, Austria&amp;#8211;Hungary.
After serving in the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I, Homolka attended the Imperial Academy of Music and the Performing Arts in Vienna and began his career on the Austrian stage. Success there led to work in the much more prestigious German theatrical community in Munich where in 1924 he played Mortimer in the premiere of Brecht&#39;s play The Life of Edward II of England at the Munich Kammerspiele, and since 1925 in Berlin where he worked under Max Reinhardt.
His first films were Die Abenteuer eines Zehnmarkscheins (The Adventures of a Ten Mark Note, 1926), Hokuspokus (Hocuspocus, 1930), and Dreyfus (The Dreyfus Case, 1930). After the Nazi rise to power, Homolka moved to Britain and later was one of the many Austrian and specifically Viennese actors and theatrical people (many of them Jewish) who fled Europe for the U.S.

As of 2008, the ward has an estimated population of 677,341 and a density of 11,360 persons per km&amp;#178;. The total area is 59.46 km&amp;#178;, the largest of the 23 special wards.
&amp;#332;ta&#39;s hub is situated around the two Kamata Stations (JR Kamata and Keikyu Kamata) where the &amp;#332;ta Ward Office and central Post Office can be found.
&amp;#332;ta has a sister city relationship with Salem, Massachusetts. The discovery of a shell mound in &amp;#332;mori, one of the forerunners of &amp;#332;ta, by Edward S. Morse, director of the museum in Salem, occasioned the tie. &amp;#332;ta has a friendship link with Chaoyang District, Beijing, People&#39;s Republic of China.
The ward was founded on March 15, 1947 merging the old wards of &amp;#332;mori and Kamata.
Tokyo International Airport (Haneda Airport, HND), now the main domestic airport for the Greater Tokyo Area, began with the establishment of Haneda Airfield in 1931 in the town of Haneda, Ebara District of Tokyo Prefecture. In 1945, it became Haneda Army Air Base under the control of the United States Army. In the same year, the Occupation ordered the expansion of the airport, evicting people from the surroundings on 48 hours&#39; notice. With&lt;/p&gt;

He rose to prominence for stylish film noir mysteries such as Laura (1944) and Fallen Angel (1945). In the 1950s and 1960s, he directed a number of high-profile adaptations of popular novels and stage works. Several of these pushed the boundaries of censorship by dealing with topics which were then taboo in Hollywood, such as drug addiction (The Man with the Golden Arm, 1955), rape (Anatomy of a Murder, 1959), and homosexuality (Advise and Consent, 1962). He was twice nominated for the Best Director Academy Award. He also had a few acting roles.
Preminger was born in 1905 in Wiznitz, a town west of Czernowitz, Northern Bukovyna, in today&#39;s Ukraine, then part of the Austro&amp;#8211;Hungarian Empire, to Markus and Josefa Preminger. Preminger&#39;s father was born in 1877 in Galicia, at a time when it was part of the Austro&amp;#8211;Hungarian Empire. As an Attorney General of Austria&amp;#8211;Hungary, Markus was a proud public prosecutor on the cusp of an extraordinary career defending the interests of the&lt;/p&gt;

The population was 24,998 at the 2000 census. It is located in the southeastern part of Iowa, and the city is split into northern and southern halves by the Des Moines River.
Ottumwa is located at 41&amp;#176;0&amp;#8242;47&amp;#8243;N 92&amp;#176;24&amp;#8242;53&amp;#8243;W&amp;#65279; / &amp;#65279;41.01306&amp;#176;N 92.41472&amp;#176;W&amp;#65279; / 41.01306; -92.41472 (41.012917, -92.414817).

Northeastern Wapello County contains large deposits of coal, and there are also large deposits of clay in the region. These were very important in the industrial development of Ottumwa.
In 1857, coal was being mined from the McCready bank, a site along Bear Creek four miles west of Ottumwa. In 1868, Brown and Godfrey opened a drift mine four miles northwest of town. By 1872, Brown and Godfrey employed 300 men and had an annual production of 77,000&amp;#160;tons. In 1880, the Phillips Coal and Mining Company opened a mine two miles northwest of town.

It has a 1,046-kilometre (650&amp;#160;mi) coastline along the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by Afghanistan and Iran in the west, India in the east and China in the far northeast. Tajikistan also lies very close to Pakistan but is separated by the narrow Wakhan Corridor. Thus, it occupies a crossroads position between South Asia, Central Asia and the Middle East. The region forming modern Pakistan was at the heart of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation and then later was the recipient of Vedic, Persian, Indo-Greek, Turco-Mongol, Islamic and Sikh cultures. The area has witnessed invasions and/or settlements by the Indo-Aryans, Persians, Greeks, Arabs, Turks, Afghans, Mongols and the British.
While the Indian independence movement demanded an independent India, the Pakistan Movement (led by Quaid e Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah of the Muslim League) sought independent states for the majority Muslim populations of the eastern and western regions of British India as well.

Earliest recorded history stems from 1769, when Gaspar de Portol&amp;#224; noted an Ohlone settlement. This remains an area of known Indian mounds. A plaque is erected at Middlefield Road and Embarcadero Road to commemorate this area.
The city got its name from a stand of tall Redwood trees, El Palo Alto, by the banks of the San Francisquito Creek bordering Menlo Park. You can still find one of these trees (the other was destroyed during a storm in the late 20th century) along the foot bridge on Alma Street.

Palpatine first appeared as the Emperor of the Galactic Empire in the 1980 film Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back as an aged, pale-faced figure who wears dark robes, and later shown to walk with the aid of a twisted wooden cane.
Palpatine rises from Senator to Emperor in the prequel trilogy, in which he appears to be a middle-aged politician of the Republic who gains power through deception and treachery. As the Senator of Naboo and later the Supreme Chancellor, he behaves like a well-intentioned and loyal public servant. Although Palpatine is a well-respected statesman, underneath his affable public persona lurks his true identity: Darth Sidious, a Dark Lord of the Sith. As both Palpatine and Sidious, he sets into motion events &amp;#8212; namely the Clone Wars &amp;#8212; which ultimately destroy the Jedi Knights and severely weaken the Galactic Senate, thereby ushering in a new totalitarian order.

Situated on the isthmus connecting North and South America, it is bordered by Costa Rica to the northwest, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the south. The capital is Panama City.
Panama is an international business center, and has the third or fourth largest economy in Central America. It is also the fastest growing economy and the largest per capita consumer in Central America.
There are several theories about the origin of the name &quot;Panama&quot;. Some believe that the country was named after a commonly found species of trees. Others believe that the first settlers arrived in Panama in August, when butterflies abound, and that the name means &quot;many butterflies&quot; in an indigenous language.
The best known version is that a fishing village and its nearby beach bore the name &quot;Panam&amp;#225;&quot;, which meant &quot;an abundance of fish&quot;. Captain Antonio Tello de Guzm&amp;#225;n, while exploring the Pacific side in 1515, stopped in the small indigenous fishing town. This was&lt;/p&gt;

There are at least four versions for the origin of the name Paraguay. The literal translation from Guaran&amp;#237; is Para = of many varieties; Gua = from, belonging to or place; Y = water, river or lake.
Paraguay is divided by the R&amp;#237;o Paraguay into the eastern region, officially called Eastern Paraguay (Paraguay Oriental) and known as the Paran&amp;#225; region; and the western region, officially called Western Paraguay (Paraguay Occidental) and also known as&lt;/p&gt;

The Bureau of the Public Debt, an agency of the U.S. Treasury Department, is headquartered in Parkersburg.
Parkersburg was originally named Newport when it was laid out in the late 1700s. A section of the land in the town was laid out over land granted to Alexander Parker for his Revolutionary War service. The title conflicts between Parker and the city planners of Newport were settled in 1809 in favor of Alexander Parker&#39;s heirs. The town was renamed Parkersburg in 1810. It was chartered by the Virginia General Assembly in 1820. It was rechartered as a city in 1860.
The town was the terminus of the Staunton-Parkersburg Turnpike and the Northwestern Turnpike. In 1857 the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad built a branch line to the town. The town was important as a transportation and medical center during the American Civil War. It then became a transportation hub in the gas and oil boom following that war.

He has had a distinguished career in theatre and television for around half a century. He is most widely known for his television and film roles, as Captain Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation and as Professor Charles Xavier in the X-Men films.
Stewart was born in Mirfield near Dewsbury in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England, the son of Gladys (n&amp;#233;e Barrowclough), a weaver and textile worker, and Alfred Stewart, a Regimental Sergeant Major in the British Army who served with the King&#39;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry (KOYLI) and previously worked as a general labourer and as a postman. Throughout childhood, he endured poverty and disadvantage, an experience which influenced his later political and ideological beliefs. In 2006, Stewart made a short video against domestic violence for Amnesty International, in which he recollected his father&#39;s physical attacks on his mother and the effect it had on him as a child, and he has given his name to a scholarship at the University of Huddersfield, where he is Chancellor, to fund post-graduate study into domestic violence.

One day he woke up with another hangover and decided it was time to go to church. Put off by the priest&#39;s incessant plea for donations, Farrelly left the Mass early. Standing alone outside in the hot sun, Farrelly looked down and saw a used condom laying on the church steps. He took this as a sign and left Las Vegas that day. He&lt;/p&gt;

The population was 14,788 at the 2000 census.
Originally called Manavon, Phoenixville was settled in 1732 and incorporated as a borough in 1849. In its industrial heyday early in the twentieth century, it was an important manufacturing center and it was the site of great iron and steel mills such as the Phoenix Iron Works, boiler works, silk mill, underwear and hosiery factories, a match factory, and the famous (and now highly collectible) Etruscan majolica pottery. Like so many American towns and cities, Phoenixville owes its growth to its waterways. It is not only situated on the broad Schuylkill River, an historic thoroughfare to Native Americans and early settlers alike, but it is bisected by the fast-flowing French Creek, which was quickly harnessed for water power.
Much of this history was recognized by the creation of the Phoenixville Historic District, the largest National Register of Historic Places site in Chester County.
Phoenixville is home to the Colonial Theatre, opened in 1903. In 1958, the&lt;/p&gt;

The islands are a British overseas territory (formerly a British colony), the last remaining in the Pacific. The four islands &amp;#8211; named Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie, and Oeno &amp;#8211; are spread over several hundred miles of ocean and have a total area of about 18&amp;#160;square miles (47&amp;#160;km). Only Pitcairn, the second largest and measuring about 2 miles across, is inhabited.
The islands are best known as home of the descendants of the Bounty mutineers and the Tahitians who accompanied them, an event retold in numerous books and films. This story is still apparent in the surnames of many of the islanders. With only 50 inhabitants (from nine families), Pitcairn is also notable for being the least populated and most remote jurisdiction in the world (although it is not a sovereign nation). The United Nations Committee on Decolonisation includes the Pitcairn Islands on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories.

It is built between the mouths of the rivers Plym to the east and Tamar to the west, where they join Plymouth Sound. Since 1967 the City of Plymouth has included the suburbs of Plympton and Plymstock, which are on the east side of the River Plym.
Plymouth&#39;s history goes back to the Bronze Age, when its first settlement grew at Mount Batten. This settlement continued to grow as a trading post for the Roman Empire, until the more prosperous village of Sutton, the current Plymouth, surpassed it. In 1620 the Pilgrim Fathers left Plymouth for the New World and established Plymouth Colony &amp;#8211; the second English settlement in what is now the United States of America. During the English Civil War the town was held by the Parliamentarians and was besieged between 1642 and 1646.
Throughout the Industrial Revolution Plymouth grew as a major shipping port, handling imports and passengers from the Americas and the construction of ships for the Royal Navy. The county boroughs of Plymouth and Devonport, and the urban district of East Stonehouse were&lt;/p&gt;

The establishment of a Polish state is often identified with the adoption of Christianity by its ruler Mieszko I, in 966, when the state covered territory similar to that of present-day Poland. The Kingdom of Poland was formed in 1025, and in 1569 it cemented a long association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the Union of Lublin, forming the Polish&amp;#8211;Lithuanian Commonwealth.

It is also the second most spoken Slavic language, after Russian.
Nearly 97% of Poland&#39;s citizens declare Polish as their mother language. Ethnic Poles constitute significant minorities in Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine.

In later centuries the town had important trade links with North America and at its peak in the 18th century it was one of the busiest ports in Britain. During the Second World War the town was one of the main departing points for the D-Day landings of the Normandy Invasion.

The city&#39;s layout is similar to that of an amphitheatre; commercial districts are near the water, while residential neighborhoods are located on the hills above. Its population is difficult to ascertain due to the rapid growth of slums in the hillsides above the city; however, recent estimates place the metropolitan area&#39;s population at between 2.5 and 3 million people.
Port-au-Prince was catastrophically affected by the January 12 2010 earthquake, with large numbers of structures damaged or destroyed. Haiti&#39;s government has estimated the death toll at 230,000 and says more bodies remain&lt;/p&gt;

The area on which the city was founded has been inhabited by the Motu-Koitabu people for centuries. It was first sighted by a European in 1873 by Captain John Moresby. It was named in honour of his father Admiral Sir Fairfax Moresby.
According to a survey of world cities by the Intelligence Unit of The Economist, Port Moresby is one of the world&#39;s least livable cities (ranks 137 of 140 cities rated).
Although it is surrounded by Central Province, where Port Moresby is also the capital, it is technically not a part of that province, and forms the National Capital District.
The Motuan people of the area now known as Port Moresby traded their pots for sago, other food and canoe logs, sailing from Hanuabada and other villages built on stilts above the waters of the bay. They also intermarried with the Gulf people and created strong family and trade links.
The Hiri expeditions were large-scale. As many as 20 multi-hulled&lt;/p&gt;

Situated on the south coast of the island of Efate, in Shefa Province, the city population at last census (1999) was 29,356, an increase of 55% on the previous census result (1989). This suggests a 2007 population of about 40,000 or around 65% of the province&#39;s population. Port Vila is the economic and commercial centre of Vanuatu.
The area occupied by Port Vila has been inhabited by Melanesian people for thousands of years. In 1606, the first Europeans arrived at the island, led by Pedro Fern&amp;#225;ndez de Quir&amp;#243;s and Luis V&amp;#225;ez de Torres. In the 19th century, French settlers established the municipality of Franceville, which declared independence in 1889 and became the first self-governing nation to practice universal suffrage without distinction of sex or race. Although the population at the time consisted of about 500 native islanders and less than 50 whites, only the latter were permitted to hold office. One of the elected presidents was a U.S. citizen by birth, R.D. Polk.
After 1887, the territory was jointly administered by the French and the British. This was formalized in 1906 as an Anglo-French&lt;/p&gt;

The commune covers an area of 110 square kilometres and as of 2002 had a population of 223,552 people.
Porto-Novo is a port on an inlet of the Gulf of Guinea, in the southeastern portion of the country. It is Benin&#39;s second largest city, and although the official capital, the city of Cotonou is more important, culturally and politically. The region around Porto-Novo produces palm oil, cotton and kapok. Petroleum was discovered off the coast of the city in the 1990s, and has become an important export.
Porto-Novo is located at 6&amp;#176;28&#39; North, 2&amp;#176;36&#39; East (6.46667, 2.6). 
Porto-Novo was once a tributary of the Yoruba kingdom of Oyo and there continues to be a sizable Yoruba community in Porto Novo today. The city&#39;s name is of Portuguese origin, meaning &quot;New Port.&quot; It was originally developed as a port for the slave trade.
In 1863, the British, who were active in nearby Nigeria, bombarded the city, which convinced the Kingdom of Porto-Novo to accept French protection. The neighboring Kingdom of Abomey objected to French involvement in the&lt;/p&gt;

It is among the oldest cities in Poland, and was one of the most important centres in the early Polish state, whose first rulers were buried at Pozna&amp;#324;&#39;s cathedral.
Pozna&amp;#324; is now Poland&#39;s fifth largest city. It is the historical capital of the Wielkopolska (&quot;Greater Poland&quot;) region, and is currently the administrative capital of the province called Greater Poland Voivodeship.
Pozna&amp;#324; is an important centre of trade, industry, and education, and hosts regular international trade fairs.

The name Pozna&amp;#324; probably comes from a personal name Poznan (from the Polish participle poznan(y) &amp;#8211; &quot;one who is known/recognized&quot;) and would mean &quot;Poznan&#39;s town&quot;.

Situated on the Vltava River in central Bohemia, Prague has been the political, cultural and economic centre of the Czech state for more than 1100 years. For many decades during the Gothic and Renaissance eras, Prague was the permanent seat of two Holy Roman Emperors and thus was also the capital of the Holy Roman Empire.
At the present time the city proper is home to about 1.3 million people, while its metropolitan area is estimated to have a population of over 1.9 million.
Since 1992, the extensive historic centre of Prague has been included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites, making the city one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe, receiving more than 4.1 million international visitors annually, as of 2009.
The name Prague comes from an old Slavic root, praga, which means &amp;#8220;ford&amp;#8221;,&lt;/p&gt;

Pretoria is contained within the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality as one of several constituent former administrations (among which also Centurion and Soshanguve). Pretoria itself is sometimes referred to as Tshwane a controversial proposed name change, the status of which is still being decided as of 2010.
The city&#39;s original name was Pretoria Philadelphia (&quot;Pretoria of brotherly love&quot;). It gave its name to the Pax Praetoriana, referring to the country&#39;s relative stability.
The Southern Transvaal Ndebele occupied the river valley, which was to become the location of the city of Pretoria, by around 1600.
During the difaqane in Natal, another band of refugees arrived in this area under the leadership of Mzilikazi. However, they were forced to abandon their villages in their flight from a regiment of Zulu raiders in 1832.

In Shrek, Lord Farquaad sends the ogre, Shrek, to retrieve Princess Fiona to be his bride. When she first appears, she is angered to learn that her rescuer is not her Prince Charming, but an ogre, and that the man who wants to marry her wouldn&#39;t come himself. At first, she refuses to travel to Farquaad, but eventually befriends Donkey and develops a bond with Shrek, since they both realize they are more similar than they first thought, and Fiona begins to doubt that Lord Farquaad is her true love. Her Dragon guardian later falls in love with Donkey. Through the course of the film, the audience discovers that she is cursed and, while she is a human by day, she becomes an ogress at sunset. The spell was placed upon her when she was a child by a Witch. (It is not known whether the Fairy Godmother placed this curse as part of her plan.)

In 2008, Princess Leia was selected by Empire Magazine as one of The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time.

According to preliminary results from the 2008 population census, it has a population of 3,255,388.
The city was split from the South P&#39;y&amp;#335;ngan province in 1946. It is administered as a directly-governed city (chikhalsi), on the same level as provincial governments, not a special city (teukbyeolsi) as Seoul is in South Korea.
A large ancient village in the P&#39;y&amp;#335;ngyang area called K&amp;#365;mtan-ni was excavated in 1955 by archaeologists who found prehistoric occupation from the Ch&amp;#365;lmun and Mumun pottery periods.
North Koreans associate Pyongyang with &quot;Asadal&quot; (&amp;#50500;&amp;#49324;&amp;#45804;; &amp;#49888;&amp;#49884;), or Wangg&amp;#335;ms&amp;#335;ng (&amp;#50773;&amp;#44160;&amp;#49457;; &amp;#29579;&amp;#20745;&amp;#22478;), the first capital of Gojoseon according to Korean history books, notably Samguk Yusa. Many South Korean historians dispute this association, because other Korean history books place Asadal around the Liao River located in western Manchuria. Nevertheless, Pyongyang became a major city under Gojoseon.
No relic from the era of Western Han has been found around Pyongyang. It is likely that the area of Pyongyang ceded from disintegrating Gojoseon and belonged to another Korean&lt;/p&gt;

It borders Yantai to the northeast, Weifang to the west and Rizhao to the southeast. Lying across the Shandong Peninsula while looking out to the Yellow Sea, Qingdao today is a major seaport, naval base, and industrial center. It is also the site of the Tsingtao Brewery. The character &amp;#38738; (q&amp;#299;ng) in Chinese means &quot;green&quot; or &quot;lush&quot;, while the character &amp;#23707; (d&amp;#462;o) means &quot;island&quot;. Qingdao is administratively at the sub-provincial level. In 2008, Qingdao was named China&#39;s 7th-most livable city.
Human settlement in the area dates back 6,000 years. The Dongyi nationality, one of the important origins of the Chinese nation, lived here and created the Dawenkou, Longshan and Dongyeshi cultures. In the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770BC~256BC), the town of Jimo was established, which was then the second largest one in the Shandong region. The area in which Qingdao is located today was named Jiao&#39;ao (&amp;#33014;&amp;#28595;) when it was&lt;/p&gt;

He also appears in the Star Wars Expanded Universe of comic books, video games, and novels. In Star Wars fiction, Qui-Gon is best known as the mentor of the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi as well as the one who discovers Anakin Skywalker (who later becomes Darth Vader).
Qui-Gon is introduced in Episode I as a wise and powerful Jedi Master and the teacher of the 25-year-old Obi-Wan Kenobi. Unlike other more conservative Jedi, he values living in the moment as the best way to embrace the Force. While other Jedi respect him, they are frequently puzzled by his unorthodox beliefs, and ultimately deny him a seat on the Jedi Council. Obi-Wan remarks that Qui-Gon has been in conflict with the Council several times in the past.
Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones reveals that he was trained in the ways of the Jedi by Count Dooku. In Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, Jedi Master Yoda reveals to Obi-Wan that Qui-Gon&#39;s spirit has learned the secret of becoming one with the Force, which he teaches to both Yoda&lt;/p&gt;

In Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, R2-D2 is introduced as a droid belonging to the Naboo defense forces, which helps repair Queen Padm&amp;#233; Amidala&#39;s starship as it attempts to get past the Trade Federation blockade, ending up as the sole surviving astromech droid out of four deployed for repair duty.

It is in the postal district of Dublin 6. It is in the local government electoral area of Rathmines and the D&amp;#225;il Constituency of Dublin South-East.
The English name is locally pronounced /&amp;#712;r&amp;#603;n&amp;#601;l&amp;#601;/. The park in London, Ranelagh Gardens, was named after Ranelagh House, home of the Cole family, who took their title (Earls of Ranelagh) from the district in County Dublin.
The district was originally a village just outside Dublin, surrounded by landed estates.
In the early years of the Irish Confederate Wars (1641-1649) the area was the scene of skirmishes culminating in the Battle of Rathmines. After the Irish united with the Royalists against the Parliamentarians, an attempt was made to take Dublin. Their army under Ormonde was defeated, many of them killed, and the place where they fell (mainly between Rathmines and Ranelagh) was known for a long time as the Bloody Fields.
In 1785, only two years after the first manned flight, Richard Crosbie successfully flew in a hot air balloon from Ranelagh Gardens to Clontarf. The 225th anniversary of his flight was commemorated&lt;/p&gt;

Redondo Beach is the focus of many who want to be in the sun and near the ocean.

The city is the second largest in the province (after Saskatoon), and is a cultural and commercial metropole for southern Saskatchewan. Its summer agricultural exhibition was originally established in 1884 as the Assiniboia Agricultural Association and since the mid-1960s has been styled &quot;Buffalo Days&quot;. It is governed by Regina City Council. Regina is the cathedral city of the Roman Catholic and Romanian Orthodox Dioceses of Regina and the Anglican Diocese of Qu&#39;Appelle. Citizens of Regina are referred to as Reginans.
Regina was previously the headquarters of the North-West Territories, of which today&#39;s provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta originally formed part, and of the District of Assiniboia. Regina was named in 1882 after Queen Victoria, i.e. Victoria Regina, by her daughter Princess Louise, wife of the then-Governor General the Marquess of Lorne.
Unlike other planned cities in the Canadian West, on its treeless flat plain Regina was a tabula rasa, without topographical features other than the small spring run-off Wascana Creek. Early planners took advantage of such opportunity by damming the creek to&lt;/p&gt;

The modern sovereign state occupies about five-sixths of the island of Ireland, which was partitioned into two jurisdictions in 1921. It is a parliamentary democracy and a republic. It is bordered to the north-east by Northern Ireland, which is a part of the United Kingdom, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, the Irish Sea to the east, St George&#39;s Channel to the south-east, and the Celtic Sea to the south.
The state, initially named the Irish Free State, was established in 1922, as a dominion within the British Commonwealth, and gained increasing sovereignty through the Statute of Westminster and the abdication crisis of 1936. A new constitution was introduced in 1937 that declared it an entirely sovereign state and named it simply as Ireland. In 1949, the last formal link with the UK was severed when Ireland declared itself a republic and formally ceased to be a dominion: consequently it left the then British Commonwealth, having already ceased to&lt;/p&gt;

It is bordered by Gabon, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly known as Zaire), the Angolan exclave province of Cabinda, and the Gulf of Guinea.
The region was dominated by Bantu tribes, who built trade links leading into the Congo River basin. The republic is a former French colony. Upon independence in 1960, the former French region of Middle Congo became the Republic of the Congo. The People&#39;s Republic of the Congo was a Marxist-Leninist single-party state from 1970 to 1991. Multiparty elections have been held since 1992, although a democratically elected government was ousted in a 1997 civil war.
The earliest inhabitants of the region were Pygmy people, who later were largely displaced and absorbed by Bantu who found tribes during the Bantu expansions. The Bakongo are a Bantu ethnicity that also occupied parts of present-day Angola, Gabon, and Democratic Republic of the Congo, forming the basis for ethnic affinities and&lt;/p&gt;

The production company The Donners&#39; Company is owned by Donner and his wife, producer Lauren Shuler Donner. After directing the horror film The Omen, Donner became famous for the hailed creation of the first modern superhero film, Superman, starring Christopher Reeve.

In 2000, he received the President&#39;s Award from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp;amp; Horror Films. He was also nominated for Best Director in 1978 for Superman. Film historian Michael Barson writes that Donner had &quot;emerged as one of Hollywood&#39;s most reliable makers of action blockbusters.&quot;
Donner was born Richard Donald Schwartzberg in the Bronx, New York City, the son of Hattie and Fred Schwartzberg; he has a sister, Joan.

Linklater was born in Houston, Texas. He studied at Sam Houston State University and left midway through his stint in college to work on an off-shore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. While working on the rig he read a lot of literature, but on land he developed a love of film through repeated visits to a repertory theater in Houston. It was at this point that Linklater realized he wanted to be a filmmaker. After his job on the oil rig, Linklater used the money he had saved to buy a Super-8 camera, a projector, and some editing equipment, and moved to Austin. It was there that the aspiring cineaste founded the Austin Film Society and grew to appreciate such auteurs as Robert Bresson, Yasujiro Ozu, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Nagisa Oshima, and Josef Von Sternberg.
Since his early 20s, Linklater has been a vegetarian.
Linklater founded the Austin Film Society in 1985 together with his frequent collaborator Lee Daniel, and is lauded for launching and solidifying the city of Austin as a hub for independent filmmaking.
For several years, Linklater made many short films that were, more than anything,&lt;/p&gt;

Morley attended Elizabeth College (an independent school in Guernsey), followed by RADA, and made his West End stage debut in 1929 in Treasure Island at the Strand Theatre and his Broadway debut in 1938 in the title role of Oscar Wilde at the Fulton Theatre. Although soon won over to the big screen, Morley remained both a busy West End star and successful author, as well as tirelessly touring.

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Robert Earl Wise (September 10, 1914 &amp;#8211; September 14, 2005) was an American sound effects editor, film editor, film producer and director. He won Academy Awards as Best Director for The Sound of Music (1965) and West Side Story (1961) as well as nominations as Best Film Editing for Citizen Kane (1941) and Best Picture for The Sand Pebbles (1966).
Among his other films are Born to Kill; The Hindenburg; Star Trek: The Motion Picture; The Day the Earth Stood Still; Run Silent, Run Deep; The Andromeda Strain; The Set-Up; The Haunting; and The Body Snatcher. Wise&#39;s working period spanned the 1930s to the 1990s.
Often contrasted with contemporary &quot;auteur&quot; directors such as Stanley Kubrick who tended to bring a distinctive directorial &quot;look&quot; to a particular genre, Wise is famously viewed to have allowed his (sometimes studio assigned) story dictate style. Later critics such as Martin Scorsese would go on to expand that characterization, insisting that despite Wise&#39;s notorious workaday concentration on stylistic perfection within the confines of genre and budget, his choice of subject matter and approach still functioned to identify Wise as an artist and not merely an artisan.

Born in Chicago, Illinois, Young was the son of an Irish immigrant father (Thomas E. Young) and an American mother (Margaret Fife). When Young was a child, the family moved to Seattle and then to Los Angeles where he attended Abraham Lincoln High School. After graduation, he studied and performed at the Pasadena Playhouse while working odd jobs and appearing in bit parts in silent films. While touring with a stock company production of The Ship, Young was discovered by an MGM talent scout and signed to a contract. He made his sound film debut for MGM in the 1931 Charlie Chan film Black Camel.
In spite of having a &quot;tier B&quot; status, he co-starred with some of the studio&#39;s most illustrious actresses such as Margaret Sullavan, Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Helen Hayes, Luise Rainer, and Helen Twelvetrees, among many others. Yet most of his assignments comprised B-movies, also known as programmers, which required a mere two to three weeks of shooting.&lt;/p&gt;

Located on both banks of the Zumbro River, it is perhaps best known as the home of Mayo Clinic (giving rise to the city&#39;s nickname, &quot;Med City&quot;) and is also home to an IBM facility. The city was estimated to have a population of 101,659 according to the Census&#39; 2008 American Community Survey released in 2009, making it Minnesota&#39;s third-largest city and the largest outside of the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The area was home to nomadic Sioux, Ojibwa, and Winnebago tribes of Native Americans. In 1851, the Sioux ceded the land to Minnesota Territory in the treaties of Traverse des Sioux and Mendota, which opened the land for settlement.
Rochester itself was founded by George Head in 1854; his land claim is now part of the city&#39;s business district.&lt;/p&gt;

It is the see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Roseau.
The central district of Roseau is tightly packed with small and large houses and even larger modern concrete structures. There is little green or open space situated within the city, and this is even more so today, as many of the courtyards which was once commonplace within the city are giving way to office space.

The first non-indigenous settlers of the area around Roswell were a group of pioneers from Missouri, who attempted to start a settlement 15 miles southwest of what is now Roswell in 1865 but were forced to abandon the site because of a lack of water. It was called Missouri Plaza.

The images pictured at right are (from top, clockwise) downtown Royal Oak looking north towards 11 Mile Road, the National Shrine of the Little Flower church, the Rackham Memorial Fountain at the Detroit Zoo, and the Woodward Dream Cruise.
Royal Oak was incorporated as a village in 1891, and as a city in 1921. The city&#39;s name originates in 1819, from one of Territorial Governor Lewis Cass&#39; expeditions surveying land. A tree located near the present day intersection of Crooks, Rochester, and Main reminded Cass of the Royal Oak tree within which King Charles II of England hid to escape the Roundheads following the Battle of Worcester.
In the 1920s, Charles Coughlin became Father of Shrine of the Little Flower, a prominent landmark in the city. In 1926, the Ku Klux Klan burned a cross on the lawn of the original wooden church, and&lt;/p&gt;

Russian belongs to the family of Indo-European languages and is one of three living members of the East Slavic languages. Written examples of Old East Slavonic are attested from the 10th century onwards. The language is one of the six official languages of the United Nations.
Russian distinguishes between consonant phonemes with palatal secondary articulation and those without, the so-called soft and hard sounds. This distinction is found between pairs of almost all consonants and is one of the most distinguishing features of the language. Another important aspect is the reduction of unstressed vowels, which is somewhat similar to that of English. Stress, which is unpredictable, is not normally indicated orthographically though, according to the Russian Language Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, an optional acute accent (&amp;#1079;&amp;#1085;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1082; &amp;#1091;&amp;#1076;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1077;&amp;#1085;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1103;) may, and sometimes should, be used to mark stress (such as to&lt;/p&gt;

Although close to the equator, the country has a cool temperate climate due to its high elevation. The terrain consists mostly of grassy uplands and gently rolling hills. Abundant wildlife, including rare mountain gorillas, have resulted in tourism becoming one of the biggest sectors of the country&#39;s economy.
Rwanda has received considerable international attention due to its 1994 genocide, in which an estimated 800,000 people were killed. Since then the country has made a recovery and is now considered as a model for developing countries. In 2009 a CNN report labeled Rwanda as Africa&#39;s biggest success story, having achieved stability, economic growth (average income has tripled in the past ten years) and international integration. The government is widely seen as one of the more efficient and honest ones in Africa. In 2007 Fortune&lt;/p&gt;

It was based on Joseph Conrad&#39;s novel The Secret Agent. It should not be confused with Hitchcock&#39;s film Secret Agent released the same year, or his 1942 film Saboteur.
Karl Verloc (Oscar Homolka), the owner of a cinema, is part of a gang of saboteurs from an unnamed European country who are planning a series of attacks in London. Their exact motives are not made clear. Scotland Yard suspects Verloc&#39;s involvement in the plot and assigns Detective Sergeant Ted Spencer (John Loder) to investigate Verloc, initially under cover. Spencer conducts the investigation posing as a greengrocer&#39;s helper, selling fruit and vegetables in a shop right next to the cinema.
Verloc&#39;s young and beautiful wife (Sylvia Sidney) believes that her husband is a good man because he has been kind to her and her little brother, Stevie (Desmond Tester), who lives with them. However, gradually she comes to suspect that her husband may be one of the people behind the terrorist attacks. The final straw comes when her little brother is killed, along with many other people, when a bus explodes. The boy had&lt;/p&gt;

The capital city and headquarters of government for the federated state is Basseterre on the larger island of Saint Kitts. The smaller state of Nevis lies about 2 miles (3&amp;#160;km) southeast of Saint Kitts, across a shallow channel called &quot;The Narrows&quot;.

Saint Lucia was founded in 1886 by Sir Arthur Sidders when he set sail from the port of Bristol, England. Part of the Lesser Antilles, it is located north/northeast of the islands of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, northwest of Barbados and south of Martinique. It covers a land area of 620&amp;#160;km&amp;#178; (238&amp;#160;mi&amp;#178;) and has an estimated population of 160,000. Its capital is Castries. The island nation has been the home of two Nobel laureates, Arthur Lewis and Derek Walcott. It is the nation with the second most such honorees per capita after Faroe Islands.
One of the Windward Islands, it was named for Saint Lucy of Syracuse by the French, the first European colonizers. They signed a treaty with the native Carib peoples in 1660. Great Britain took control of the island from 1663 to 1667; in ensuing years, it was at war with France 14 times and rule of the island changed frequently. In 1814, the British took definitive control of the island. Because it switched so often between British and French control, Saint Lucia was also known as the&lt;/p&gt;

Its 389-square-kilometre (150&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi) territory consists of the main island of Saint Vincent and the northern two-thirds of the Grenadines, which are a chain of smaller islands stretching south from Saint Vincent to Grenada.
To the north of St. Vincent lies St. Lucia, to the east Barbados, and to the south Grenada. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has an estimated population of 120,000 and the capital is Kingstown. The country has a French and British colonial history and is now part of the Commonwealth of Nations and CARICOM.
The island now known as Saint Vincent was originally named &quot;Hairouna&quot; by the Carib Indians. Carib Indians aggressively prevented European settlement on St. Vincent until the 18th century. At that time, formerly enslaved Africans, who had either been shipwrecked or who had escaped from Barbados, St. Lucia and Grenada and sought refuge in mainland St. Vincent, intermarried with the Caribs and became known as Garifuna or Black Caribs.
Beginning in 1719, French settlers gained control of the island and&lt;/p&gt;

Samoa was admitted to the United Nations on 15 December 1976. The entire island group, inclusive of American Samoa, was called Navigators Islands by European explorers before the 20th century because of the Samoans&#39; seafaring skills.
The Samoans originated from Austronesian predecessors during the terminal eastward Lapita expansion period from Southeast Asia and Melanesia approximately 1500 BCE. The Samoan origins are currently being reassessed due to new scientific evidence and carbon dating findings from 2003 and onwards.
Intimate sociocultural and genetic ties were maintained between the eastern Lapita colonies and the archaeological record supports oral tradition and native genealogies that indicate inter-island voyaging and intermarriage&lt;/p&gt;

Because of its agreeable climate, Santa Monica had become a famed resort town by the early 20th century. The city has experienced a boom since the late 1980s through the revitalization of its downtown core with significant job growth and increased tourism.
The Santa Monica Hippodrome (carousel) is a National Historic Landmark. It sits on the Santa Monica Pier, which was built in 1909. The La Monica Ballroom on the pier was once the largest ballroom in the US, and the source for many New Year&#39;s Eve national network&lt;/p&gt;

It was directed by Brian Dannelly and written by Dannelly and Michael Urban. It stars Jena Malone, Mandy Moore, Macaulay Culkin, Patrick Fugit, Eva Amurri, Martin Donovan, and Mary-Louise Parker. The film touches the issues of religion, ostracism, homophobia, teen pregnancy, divorce, and disabilities.

Everything seems perfect&amp;#8212;until Mary&amp;#8217;s &quot;perfect Christian boyfriend&quot; Dean (Chad Faust) tells her, as they&amp;#8217;re swimming underwater, that he thinks he&#39;s gay.
In her shock, Mary hits her head in the pool and has a vision in which Jesus tells her that she must do everything she can to help Dean. Hoping for a sign, Mary goes to a shooting range with Hilary Faye, who has a &quot;spiritual solution for everything&quot; and tells Mary (not knowing about the situation with Dean) that if all else&lt;/p&gt;

Scarborough won the 2008/2009 award for the most creative and inspiring entrepreneurship initiative in Europe. This is on top of winning the most enterprising town in Britain in 2008. The modern town lies between 3&amp;#160;and&amp;#160;70&amp;#160;metres (10&amp;#160;and&amp;#160;230&amp;#160;ft) above sea level, rising steeply northward and westward from the harbour onto limestone cliffs. The older part of the town lies around the harbour and is protected by a rocky headland. Scarborough is served by Scarborough railway station, with services from York, Leeds, Manchester and Liverpool on the North TransPennine route and from Hull on the Yorkshire Coast Line.
With a population of around 50,000, Scarborough is the largest holiday resort on the Yorkshire coast. It is home to residential communities, business, fishing and service industries, plus a growing digital and creative economy.
The most striking feature of the town&#39;s geography is a high rocky promontory pointing eastward into the North Sea. The promontory supports the 11th century ruins of Scarborough Castle and separates the sea front into a North Bay and a South Bay. The South Bay was the site of the&lt;/p&gt;

It was named in 1796 by Elizabeth Simcoe, who was inspired by the Scarborough Bluffs, which reminded her of the white cliffs near her home in England. Initially a collection of rural villages, it has become a diverse urban community. Over 200 years it grew from a township to a city, but has been part of the eastern portion of Toronto since 1998. The name &quot;Scarborough&quot; is still used by local residents and recognized by Canada Post.
Scarborough has characteristics of a suburb of old Toronto, but retains much of its own character and flavour. Certain neighbourhoods in Scarborough are popular destinations for new immigrants to Canada, who bring their own culture to Scarborough. It includes some remote areas such as the Scarborough Bluffs and the Rouge River Valley. A journalist describing Toronto&#39;s suburbs commented on Scarborough&#39;s &quot;lush greenery&quot; and declared it to be greener than any other part of Toronto.
The area was named after Scarborough, Yorkshire, England by Elizabeth Simcoe, the wife of John Graves Simcoe, the first lieutenant governor of Upper Canada. The&lt;/p&gt;

Johansson rose to fame with her roles in 1998&#39;s The Horse Whisperer and 2001&#39;s Ghost World.
She made the transition to adult roles with her performances in Sofia Coppola&#39;s Lost in Translation, for which she won a BAFTA Award, and Girl with a Pearl Earring, both of which earned her Golden Globe Award nominations in 2003. A role in A Love Song for Bobby Long earned her a third Golden Globe for Best Actress nomination. Following an appearance in The Island, Johansson garnered a fourth Golden Globe nomination, for Best Supporting Actress, for her role in Woody Allen&#39;s Match Point. She followed that with another Allen film, Scoop, with Hugh Jackman. A role in Brian de Palma&#39;s film noir The Black Dahlia was followed by a second role opposite Hugh Jackman in The Prestige, also starring Christian Bale.

Entertainment. It is an American dark comedy which parodies the horror, slasher, and mystery genres. Several mid-and late-1990s films are spoofed, including The Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects, The Matrix, and The Blair Witch Project, with a significant portion of the film&#39;s plot being dedicated to the more subtle horror film parody series Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. In addition, the film parodies classic horror films, most notably Halloween.
The tagline is &quot;No mercy. No shame. No sequel.&quot;, with the last reference being to the tendency of popular horror movies to become long-running franchises. However, in 2001, Scary Movie 2 was released (with the tagline &quot;We lied&quot;). The film was followed by a series of sequels Scary Movie 3 (2003), and Scary Movie 4 (2006). The original title for the film Scream was &quot;Scary Movie&quot; which ironically was later used to parody it. Both films were released through Dimension Films.

As of the 2000 census, the city had a population of 61,821, making it the ninth-largest city in New York. The name &quot;Schenectady&quot; is derived from a Mohawk word for &quot;on that side of the pinery,&quot; or &quot;near the pines,&quot; or &quot;place beyond the pine plains.&quot;
The city of Schenectady is in eastern New York, near the confluence of the Mohawk and Hudson Rivers. It is in the same metropolitan area as the state capital, Albany; Schenectady is about fifteen miles (24&amp;#160;km) northwest of Albany.
The area that is now Schenectady was originally the land of the Mohawk nation of the Iroquois Confederacy. When Dutch settlers arrived in the Hudson Valley in the middle of the 17th century, the Mohawk called the settlement at Fort Orange &quot;Schau-naugh-ta-da&quot;, meaning &quot;over the pine plains.&quot; Eventually, this word entered the lexicon of the Dutch settlers, but the meaning was reversed, and the name referred to the bend in the Mohawk River where the city lies today.
Schenectady was first settled in 1661 when the area was part of the Dutch colony of New Netherland. Settlement was led by&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Schtonk! (1992) is a satirical German movie, retelling the hoax of the Hitler Diaries.
Subtitled Der Film zum Buch vom F&amp;#252;hrer (&quot;The film accompanying the F&amp;#252;hrer&#39;s book&quot;), the movie is a grotesque farce about the events when, in 1983, German Stern magazine began to publish, with great fanfare, the 60 volumes of the alleged diaries of Adolf Hitler &amp;#8211; which two weeks later turned out to be entirely fake. That story is commonly described one of the greatest failures of modern journalism overall.
The film is widely considered a hilarious tale, making fun not only of the events and characters who were involved in the hoax, and who are only thinly disguised in the movie, but also of the discomfort Germany has with its difficult past. It is especially fun to viewers familiar with the country.
The film is co-written and directed by Helmut Dietl and, among his many respected comedies, frequently considered his best. Dietl researched the scandal for two years and has been quoted as having to leave out several real events from the movie because they were too outrageous.
The title is a bow to Charlie Chaplin&#39;s classic The Great Dictator, in which the Fooey repeatedly uses &quot;Schtonk!&quot; as an&lt;/p&gt;

Focus Features released the film, which was rated PG-13 by the MPAA for &quot;some sexual content.&quot;
Following the memorial service for irrepressible investigative reporter Joe Strombel (McShane), Strombel&#39;s spirit finds himself on the barge of death with several others, including a young woman who believes she was poisoned by her employer, Peter Lyman (Jackman). The woman tells Strombel she thinks Lyman, a handsome British aristocrat with political ambitions, may be the Tarot Card Killer, a notorious serial killer of prostitutes, and that he killed her when she stumbled onto his secret. The Tarot Card Killer left a card on each dead body after each murder.
Sondra Pransky (Johansson) is a beautiful but somewhat awkward American college journalist on vacation in London. Pransky attends a performance given by magician Sid Waterman (Allen), aka &quot;The Great Splendini,&quot; and agrees to participate on the stage. While in a booth known as The Dematerializer, Pransky encounters Strombel&#39;s ghost who has escaped the Grim Reaper himself to&lt;/p&gt;

Occupying the northern third of the island of Great Britain, it shares a border with England to the south and is bounded by the North Sea to the east, the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west, and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the southwest. In addition to the mainland, Scotland includes over 790 islands including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.
Edinburgh, the country&#39;s capital and second largest city, is one of Europe&#39;s largest financial centres. Edinburgh was the hub of the Scottish Enlightenment of the 18th century, which transformed Scotland into one of the commercial, intellectual and industrial powerhouses of Europe. Glasgow, Scotland&#39;s largest city, was once one of the world&#39;s leading industrial cities and now lies at the centre of the Greater Glasgow conurbation. Scottish waters consist of a large sector of the North Atlantic and the North Sea, containing the largest oil reserves in the European Union. This has given Aberdeen, the third largest city in Scotland, the title of Europe&#39;s oil capital.

As of 2010 the population of the city was 245,500. Scottsdale is regarded as an upscale tourist and shopping destination and as a representation of western American style. The New York Times described downtown Scottsdale as &quot;a desert version of Miami&#39;s South Beach&quot; and as having &quot;plenty of late night partying and a buzzing hotel scene&quot;.
Scottsdale is bordered to the west by Phoenix and Paradise Valley, to the north by Carefree, to the south by Tempe, and to the east by Fountain Hills and the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community.
Scottsdale was originally inhabited by Hohokam. From 800 AD to 1400 AD, this ancient civilization farmed the area and built irrigation canals.
Before European settlement, Scottsdale was a Pima village. Some Pima remained in their original homes well into the 20th century. By now, however, all Pima have either been priced out of town or moved into newer homes within Scottsdale; primarily South Scottsdale, the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, or elsewhere.

It stars Maggie Gyllenhaal as Lee Holloway and James Spader as E. Edward Grey. The film is based on a short story from Bad Behavior by Mary Gaitskill.
Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal), the socially awkward and emotionally sensitive youngest daughter of a dysfunctional family, adjusts to normal life after having been hospitalized following an incident of dangerous self-harm. She learns to type, starts to date an acquaintance from high school named Peter, and begins to work as a secretary for an eccentric attorney, E. Edward Grey (James Spader), who hires her despite her stilted social skills and unprofessional appearance.
Though at first Grey appears highly irritated at Lee&#39;s typos and other innocuous mistakes, it soon becomes apparent that he is sexually aroused by her submissive behavior. After he confronts her about her self-injury addiction and commands that she never hurt herself again, the two embark on a BDSM relationship. Lee experiences a sexual - and personal - awakening, and she falls deeply in love. Edward, however, displays insecurity concerning his feelings for Lee, and he&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Series 7: The Contenders is a 2001 film directed by Daniel Minahan. The movie is presented as a marathon of the seventh series of an American reality television show called The Contenders, where six people, picked at random from a national lottery, are each given a gun and forced to hunt and kill each other for the cameras. The film is a dark satire of the reality television genre. It stars Brooke Smith as Dawn, the reigning champion from the sixth series. It shares similarities with cult Japanese film, Battle Royale, 1986 Schwarzenegger vehicle The Running Man, and several other films.
Five new contestants are selected in a seemingly random lottery and, along with the winner of the previous series, comprise the six Contenders. Each series of The Contenders is played in the limits of a chosen city or town. Contenders are given a gun, though they may acquire other weapons, and the last one left alive is the winner. Contestants are forced to play the game, regardless of whether they desire to. A contender who wins three tours of the game is freed from it.
The film purposely leaves many key details unexplained, as the viewer is supposed to be watching only what the creators actually&lt;/p&gt;

It was directed by Stanley Donen, with music by Saul Chaplin and Gene de Paul, and lyrics by Johnny Mercer. The script (by Albert Hackett, Frances Goodrich, and Dorothy Kingsley) is based on the short story The Sobbin&#39; Women, by Stephen Vincent Ben&amp;#233;t, which was based in turn on the Ancient Roman legend of The Rape of the Sabine Women. The film was a 1954 Oscar nominee for Best Picture.
The film is particularly known for the unusual choreography by Michael Kidd, which makes dance numbers out of such mundane frontier pursuits as chopping wood and (most famously) raising a barn.
The film&#39;s story is about a backwoodsman named Adam Pontipee and his new bride Milly, who marries him after knowing him for only a few hours. On returning with him to his cabin in the mountains, Milly is surprised to learn that Adam is one of seven lumberjack brothers living in the same cabin. The brothers have been named alphabetically from the Old Testament: Adam, Benjamin, Caleb, Daniel, Ephraim, Frank (short for Frankincense, the Old Testament having no names beginning with F), and Gideon. All of the brothers have red hair and are well&lt;/p&gt;

The film takes place in Warring States Period Japan (around 1587/1588). It follows the story of a village of farmers that hire seven masterless samurai (ronin) to combat bandits who will return after the harvest to steal their crops.
Seven Samurai is described as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, and is one of a select few Japanese films to become widely known in the West for an extended period of time. It is the subject of both popular and critical acclaim; it was voted onto Sight &amp;amp; Sound&#39;s list of the ten greatest films of all time in 1982 and 1992, and remains on the directors&#39; top ten films in the 2002 poll.
A gang of marauding bandits approaches a mountain village. The bandit chief recognizes they have ransacked this village before, and decides it is best that they spare it until the harvest in several months. Two of the villagers happens to overhear the discussion. The news leaves the villagers divided about whether to surrender their harvest or fight back against the bandits. They go to the village elder, who declares that they should&lt;/p&gt;

The movie was the opening film to the 2005 Venice Film Festival and is a homage movie to Akira Kurosawa&#39;s Seven Samurai (1954).
In the mid-1600s, the Manchurians have taken over sovereignty of China and established the Qing Dynasty. While nationalistic sentiments start brewing within the martial artists&#39; community (Jianghu), the Qing government immediately imposes a &quot;Martial Arts Ban&quot; (&amp;#31105;&amp;#27494;&amp;#20196;), forbidding the common people to practice martial arts. This is a means of maintaining law and order, as well as provide the Qing government with sufficient reason to put down any potential rebellion by nationalist martial artists. Fire-Wind, a military officer who formerly served the fallen Ming Dynasty, sees the new law as an opportunity for himself to make fortune by assisting the government in executing the law. Greedy, cruel and immoral, Fire-Wind ravages northwest China, killing thousands of martial artists as well as innocent civilians with his army. His next goal is to attack&lt;/p&gt;

The two protagonists, Max and Albert, played by Jerzy Stuhr and Olgierd &amp;#321;ukaszewicz, respectively, submit themselves in 1991 to the first human hibernation experiment. Instead of being awakened a few years later as planned, they wake up in the year 2044, in a post-nuclear world. By then, humans have retreated to underground living facilities, and, as a result of subjection to a specific kind of radiation, all males have died out. Women reproduce through parthenogenesis.
The cold-shoulder treatment Max and Albert receive from the women, their character differences and specific realities of future life serve as background of many humorous encounters. The plot thickens when it turns out that the females have no interest in the rebirth of men, and that for the good of society, the two males are to be &#39;naturalised&#39;, i.e. undergo a sex-change. While trying to break away, Max and Albert find out the impact of their masculinity on women. With one of the scientists on their side, step by step they&lt;/p&gt;

Other nearby island countries and territories include Zanzibar to the west, Mauritius and R&amp;#233;union to the south, Comoros and Mayotte to the southwest. The Seychelles has the smallest population of any African state.
Austronesian seafarers or Arab traders were the first to visit the uninhabited Seychelles. the first known European recorded sighting of them took place in 1502, by the Portuguese Admiral Vasco da Gama, who passed through the Amirantes and named them after himself (islands of the Admiral). The first recorded landing and first written account was by the crew of the English East Indiaman Ascension in 1609.
As a transit point for trading between Africa and Asia, they were occasionally used by pirates until the French began to take control of the islands starting in 1756 when a Stone of Possession was laid by Captain Nicholas Morphey. The&lt;/p&gt;

The film is largely fictional, although several of the characters are based on real people. In addition, many of the characters, lines, and plot devices are references to Shakespeare&#39;s plays.
Shakespeare in Love won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actress (for Gwyneth Paltrow) and Best Supporting Actress (for Judi Dench). It was the first comedy to win the Best Picture award since Annie Hall (1977).
The film centres around the forbidden love of William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) and Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow), the daughter of a wealthy merchant.
As the film begins, theatre manager Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush) finds himself in debt to loan shark Hugh Fennyman (Tom Wilkinson). Henslowe offers Fennyman a partnership in the upcoming production of Shakespeare&#39;s newest comedy &amp;#8212; Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate&#39;s Daughter &amp;#8212; promising that it will be a hit. However, after learning that his love was cheating on him with his&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Shallow Hal is a 2001 romantic comedy film starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Jack Black. It was directed by Peter Farrelly and Bobby Farrelly, and filmed in and around Charlotte, North Carolina as well as Sterling and Princeton, Massachusetts at Wachusett Mountain.
Hal Larson (Jack Black) is a superficial man whose fixation on physical beauty (despite being obese himself) gets in the way of seeing women for their inner beauty. Hal and his equally shallow friend Mauricio Wilson (Jason Alexander) spend most of their nights being obnoxious at nightclubs and being shot down. By a twist of fate, Hal becomes stuck in an elevator with famous American life coach Tony Robbins, who hypnotizes him into seeing people as their inner beauty instead of their external selves. Hal meets and is smitten by his boss&#39;s daughter, Rosemary Shanahan (Gwyneth Paltrow). Rosemary is actually obese, but appears to him as slender and beautiful due to her kind and generous nature. Used to being overlooked by men due to her appearance, Rosemary initially interprets Hal&#39;s interest in her as mocking and insulting, but later realizes his feelings for her are genuine, and the two begin to date.
Mauricio becomes worried&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Shane is a 1953 American Western film produced and directed by George Stevens from a screenplay by A.B. Guthrie Jr., based on the 1949 novel of the same name by Jack Schaefer. The film stars Alan Ladd, Jean Arthur and Van Heflin, and features Brandon De Wilde, Elisha Cook Jr., Jack Palance and Ben Johnson. The cinematography was by Loyal Griggs, with a music score by Victor Young.
A mysterious stranger who calls himself Shane (Alan Ladd) drifts into an isolated western valley. It soon becomes apparent that he is a gunslinger, and he finds himself drawn into a conflict between simple homesteader Joe Starrett (Van Heflin) and powerful cattle baron Rufus Ryker (Emile Meyer), who want to force Starrett and every other homesteader in the valley off the land. Shane accepts a job as a farmhand, but finds Starrett&#39;s young son Joey (Brandon DeWilde) drawn to him for his strength and skill with a gun. Shane himself is uncomfortably drawn to Starrett&#39;s wholesomely charming wife, Marian (Jean Arthur).
As tensions mount between the factions, Ryker hires Jack Wilson (Jack Palance), a skilled gunslinger. After Wilson kills another homesteader (Elisha Cook, Jr.) who had stood up to him, Joe&lt;/p&gt;

It was directed by David Dobkin and written by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, The Last film of a 5-year distribution deal with Spyglass Entertaiment and The Walt Disney Company.
The film opens in the Forbidden City in 1887, where Chon Lin (Fann Wong) is drinking tea with her father, the Keeper of the Imperial Seal of China. She tells him her brother, Chon Wang (Jackie Chan), is doing well as a sheriff in Carson City, Nevada, United States, but her father replies that her brother is dead to him. At that moment, Lord Nelson Rathbone (Aidan Gillen), leads a band of Boxers into the city, who attack the Keeper. Lin defends her father, but is knocked unconscious. Rathbone kills him with a snake-handled dagger, and leaves with the seal. As he lies dying, he gives Chon Lin a puzzle box and a letter to Chon Wang.
Back in the Wild West, Chon Wang is doing well as sheriff, having captured an impressive array of fugitives. His deputy is relaxing with a book called &quot;Roy O&#39;Bannon Vs. The Mummy&quot;, a highly fictionalized account of the events of the first film that now portrays Wang&#39;s &quot;Shanghai Kid&quot; as a cowardly&lt;/p&gt;

Directed by Tom Dey, it was written by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar. The movie, set in Nevada and other parts of the west in the 19th century, is a juxtaposition of a western with a kung fu action movie with extended martial arts sequences. It also has elements of comedy and the &quot;Buddy Cop&quot; film genre, as it involves two men of different personalities and ethnicities (a Chinese imperial guard and a Western outlaw) who team up to stop a crime.
It was partially filmed in the Canadian Badlands, near Drumheller, Alberta, Canada. A sequel, Shanghai Knights, was released in 2003.
Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) is an imperial guard of China. After Princess Pei-Pei (Lucy Liu), who Wang has affection for, is abducted by Calvin Andrews (Jason Connery) and taken to the United States, the Emperor of China sends three of his bravest guards to retrieve her. Wang is not among one of the three, but after he tells them that it was his fault the princess was kidnapped, he is sent merely in the hopes that the &quot;foreign devils&quot; would get rid of Wang for China. In Nevada, Roy O&#39;Bannon (Owen Wilson)&lt;/p&gt;

A former Shaolin monk reunites his five brothers, years after their master&#39;s death, to apply their superhuman martial arts skills to play soccer and bring Shaolin kung fu to the masses.
In 2008 a sequel, produced by, but not starring Stephen Chow, was released entitled Shaolin Girl. Very few of the cast from the original film made an appearance.
Sing (Stephen Chow) is a master of Shaolinquan kung fu, whose goal in life is to promote the spiritual and practical benefits of the art to modern society. He experiments with various methods to inform the modern world about shaolin kung fu, some of which include comedic song and dance routines, but all bear no positive results. He then meets Fung (Ng Man Tat), a legendary soccer star in his days, until his teammate Hung, now a rich businessman, paid him to miss a goal. After missing the game-winning penalty kick, Fung&#39;s &amp;#8220;Golden leg&amp;#8221; is broken by an angry baseball bat-wielding mob (hired by Hung), forcing him to retire from active play. Years later, on the day Fung learns of Hung&#39;s treachery, he meets Sing while in a drunken&lt;/p&gt;

In the story, a young fish named Oscar (voiced by Will Smith) falsely claims to have killed the son of a shark mob boss to win favour with the mob boss&#39; enemies and advance his own community standing. The film additionally features the voices of Jack Black as Lenny, Ren&amp;#233;e Zellweger as Angie, Angelina Jolie as Lola, Martin Scorsese as Sykes, and Robert De Niro as Don Lino. Its original title was Sharkslayer, but the producers thought that this might provoke a degree of misunderstanding among the target audience of the film, children and families. Shark Tale is also one of the first three feature-length films to be made into a Game Boy Advance Video. It was released into theaters on October 1, 2004. Although the film was a critical flop (especially when compared to the critically acclaimed Finding Nemo, a film with a similar theme), it was nominated for an Academy Award and a commercial success, grossing $367,275,019. The name is itself a parody of A Bronx Tale.
The story begins with an underachieving fish named Oscar (Will Smith), who is fantasizing about being rich and famous while making his way to work by following&lt;/p&gt;

Its name derives from the River Sheaf, which runs through the city. Historically a part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, the city has grown from its largely industrial roots to encompass a wider economic base. The population of the City of Sheffield is 534,500 (2008&amp;#160;est.), but the wider Sheffield Urban Area, which extends beyond the city proper, had a population of 640,720 as of the 2001 census. Sheffield is one of the eight largest regional English cities that make up the English Core Cities Group.
During the 19th century, Sheffield gained an international reputation for steel production. Many innovations were developed locally, including crucible and stainless steel, fuelling an almost tenfold increase in the population during the Industrial Revolution. Sheffield received its municipal charter in 1893, when it officially became the City of Sheffield. International competition in iron and steel caused a decline in traditional local industries during the 1970s and 1980s, coinciding with the collapse of coal mining in the area.
The 21st century has seen extensive redevelopment&lt;/p&gt;

Though set during the American Civil War, the film&#39;s strong antiwar and humanitarian themes reflect attitudes at the time of the movie&#39;s release, toward the Vietnam War. Upon its release, the film was praised for its message, as well as its technical production. In 1966, the film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound. Due in part to her performance in Shenandoah, Rosemary Forsyth was nominated for a Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer - Female.
In view of the decidedly anti-war tone of this film, and that of the character of Charlie Anderson, it is worth noting that James Stewart was a brigadier general in the US Air Force Reserve at the time of its filming, and had been a decorated bomber pilot and squadron commander in World War II; he would fly as an observer and additional pilot on one B-52 mission in Vietnam as part of his reserve duty a year after the film&#39;s release.
Stewart&#39;s own son Ronald (adopted from his wife&#39;s first marriage) would be killed in action in Vietnam as a US Marine Corps officer a few years later. Stewart had four children, including twin&lt;/p&gt;

A movie projectionist and janitor (Buster Keaton) who is studying to become a detective is in love with a beautiful girl (Kathryn McGuire). On a date he presents her with chocolates and an engagement ring. However, there is another man who&#39;s also interested in his girl (Ward Crane).
One day he is accused of stealing his girlfriend&#39;s father&#39;s watch. He falls asleep on the job and dreams that he is a Sherlock Holmes-type detective, solving the case of who stole a valuable pearl necklace.
Keaton spent more time shooting this film than most of his others, due to the elaborate stunts and effects.

At the outset of the film, his popular girlfriend, Taylor Vaughn (Jodi Lyn O&#39;Keefe) dumps him for a faded reality TV star (Matthew Lillard) whom she met on spring break. Although he is hurt by Taylor&#39;s rejection, Zack consoles himself by saying that Taylor is replaceable. Zack&#39;s best friend, Dean Sampson, Jr.(Paul Walker), disagrees. They make a bet on whether or not Zack can turn any girl into the prom queen within six weeks. While walking around the school, Dean picks out Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook), a morose, but highly responsible, art student, as his choice for Zach.
Zack approaches Laney in the attempt to transform her into the prom queen. His first encounter with her is a failure, when she pointedly ignores his attempt to befriend her. Laney&#39;s little brother Simon (Kieran Culkin) continuously talks Zack up to Laney. Zack is&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;She&#39;s Having a Baby is an American romance movie, released in 1988, which was directed by John Hughes.
The movie portrays a young newlywed couple, Kristy and Jake Briggs played by Elizabeth McGovern and Kevin Bacon, who try to cope with being married and what is expected of them by their parents. Jake must also deal with the fantasy woman of his dreams. The film is largely a parody of traditional 1980s suburban life and the cultural expectations that come along with it. To a large extent what Jake experiences could be described as a form of culture shock, with his best man Davis (Alec Baldwin) as a reminder of his former culture as a single man, and feeling alienated when he overhears his neighbors converse about mundane suburban topics. He feels he has left the culture of single men, and has entered the culture of a married man, and doesn&#39;t appear to have a sense of belonging to either.
This film is a look at the lives of Jake and Kristy Briggs, from their wedding day until the birth of their first child. Beginning on their wedding day, it follows both their lives, but more so Jake&#39;s, with his voice over commentaries and several imaginary scenes, based on actual or feared future&lt;/p&gt;

It is the seat of Caddo Parish and extends slightly into neighboring Bossier Parish. Bossier City is separated from Shreveport by the Red River. The population was 200,145 at the 2000 census, and the Shreveport-Bossier City Metropolitan Area population exceeds 375,000.
Shreveport was founded in 1836 by the Shreve Town Company, a corporation established to develop a town at the juncture of the newly navigable Red River and the Texas Trail, an overland route into the newly independent Republic of Texas and, prior to that time, into Mexico.
Shreveport is the commercial and cultural center of the Ark-La-Tex, the area where Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas meet. Many people in the community refer to the two cities of Shreveport and Bossier City as &quot;Shreveport-Bossier&quot;.
The Shreve Town Company was established to launch a town at the meeting point of the Red River and the Texas Trail. The Red River was cleared and made newly navigable by Captain Henry Miller Shreve, who commanded the United States Army&lt;/p&gt;

The film portrays the life of Sid Vicious, bassist of the seminal punk rock band the Sex Pistols. It stars Gary Oldman as Vicious and Chloe Webb as his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen.
The film opens with several police officers dragging a distressed Sid Vicious (Gary Oldman) out of the Chelsea Hotel. On the way out reporters relentlessly pursue Sid, asking him why he did it, Sid telling them off in reply. Vicious is soon driven to a police station and upon arrival is asked to describe what has happened to him up to this point and if he was the one who called the police. Sid recounts the details of what happened in his life.
A few years earlier, Sid and John Lydon (Andrew Schofield) are shown smashing the windows of a car until a small black puppy is shown to be inside. Lydon jokingly provokes Sid to &quot;slay the beast,&quot; but Sid instead pets the dog&#39;s head and they leave the ruined car behind with the dog looking on in confusion.
Later back at a bar, Lydon and Sid meet up with Paul Cook (Perry Benson) and Steve Jones (Tony London) at a bar where the group proceeds to drink and throw darts.&lt;/p&gt;

Sid Vicious was born John Simon Ritchie in London to John and Anne Ritchie (n&amp;#233;e McDonald). His father was a guardsman at Buckingham Palace and a semi-professional trombone player on the London Jazz scene. Shortly after Simon&#39;s birth, John Ritchie left the family.

Sid had taken his stepfather&#39;s surname and became John Beverley.
His stepfather died six months later, and by 1968 Ritchie and his mother were living in a rented flat in Tunbridge Wells where he attended Sandown Court School. In 1971, the pair moved to Hackney in East London. He also spent some time living in Somerset, where he was a pupil at Clevedon Secondary Modern.

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;A silent film is a film with no synchronized recorded sound, especially spoken dialogue. In entertainment silent films the acting and dialogue is commuted through muted gestures, pantomime and title cards. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. After The Jazz Singer in 1927, &quot;talkies&quot; became more and more commonplace and within a decade silent films essentially disappeared.
The first film was created by Louis Le Prince in 1888. It was a two second film of people walking around in Oakwood Grange garden, titled Roundhay Garden Scene. The art of motion pictures grew into full maturity in the &quot;silent era&quot; before silent films were replaced by &quot;talking pictures&quot; in the late 20s. Many film scholars and buffs argue that the aesthetic quality of cinema decreased for several years until directors, actors, and production staff adapted to the new &quot;talkies&quot;.

The story is an adaptation of the Silent Hill series of survival horror games created by Konami. The film, particularly its emotional, religious and aesthetic content as well as its creature design, includes elements from Silent Hill, Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 3. The film also includes some music, such as &quot;Wounded Warsong&quot;, from the fourth game. A game in the series released after the film, Silent Hill Homecoming, incorporated some elements of the film.
The film follows a mother, Rose, who takes her troubled adopted daughter, Sharon, to Silent Hill, the town the girl cries out for while sleepwalking. After being knocked unconscious in a car crash outside the town, Rose awakens to find her daughter missing and the town engulfed in an alternate reality of fog and falling ash. While searching for her daughter, she faces surreal reality shifts and monstrous creatures while uncovering her daughter&#39;s connections to the town&#39;s dark secrets.
Rose (Radha Mitchell) and her husband Christopher Da Silva (Sean Bean) are concerned about their adopted daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) who has been&lt;/p&gt;

It stars Gene Wilder, Jill Clayburgh, Richard Pryor, Patrick McGoohan and Ned Beatty and is directed by Arthur Hiller. The film score is by Henry Mancini. This film marked the first pairing of Wilder and Pryor, who would become a well-known comedy duo. The climax of the film includes footage of an out-of-control train crashing through the wall of Union Station in Chicago.
Saying he &quot;just wanted to be bored&quot;, book editor George Caldwell (Gene Wilder) travels from Los Angeles to Chicago aboard a train called the Silver Streak. As the trip begins, George meets a man who calls himself Bob Sweet (Ned Beatty) and has dinner with a woman named Hilly Burns (Jill Clayburgh) who works for Professor Schreiner, an art historian who is publicizing his new book on Rembrandt. After dinner, George and Hilly go to Hilly&#39;s room.
Meanwhile, three men kill Schreiner. A few minutes later, George momentarily sees Schreiner&#39;s body outside Hilly&#39;s window. In the morning, he sees Schreiner&#39;s photograph on the cover of his book, which Hilly has with her, and recognizes him as the dead man. George also finds an&lt;/p&gt;

It is a film noir based on Miller&#39;s graphic novel series of the same name.
The film is primarily based on three of Miller&#39;s works: The Hard Goodbye, about a man who embarks on a brutal rampage in search of his one-time sweetheart&#39;s killer; The Big Fat Kill, which focuses on a street war between a group of prostitutes and a group of mercenaries; and That Yellow Bastard, which follows an aging police officer who protects a young woman from a grotesquely disfigured serial killer. The movie stars Bruce Willis, Alexis Bledel, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Michael Clarke Duncan, Rosario Dawson, Benicio del Toro, Michael Madsen, Nick Stahl, Powers Boothe, Josh Hartnett, Jaime King, Brittany Murphy, Elijah Wood and Rutger Hauer, among others.
Sin City opened to wide critical and commercial success, gathering particular recognition for the film&#39;s unique coloring procession, which rendered most of the film in black and white but retained or added coloring for select objects. The film was screened at the 2005 Cannes Film&lt;/p&gt;

Singapore is the world&#39;s fourth leading financial centre and its economy is often ranked amongst the world&#39;s top ten most open, competitive and innovative. The country is also a highly cosmopolitan World City, with a key role in international trade and finance.
Singapore has a diverse populace of 5 million people made up of Chinese, Malays, Indians, Asians and Caucasians of different ethnic origins. This is in line with the nation&#39;s history as an immigrant nation.
The populace of Singapore has the sixth highest percentage of foreigners in the world. 42% of the population in Singapore are foreigners and foreigners make up 50% of the service sector.   The country is also the second most densely populated in the world after Monaco. A.T. Kearney names Singapore as the most globalised country in the world in its Globalization Index.

It offers a comic depiction of Hollywood, and its transition from silent films to &quot;talkies.&quot;
Although it was a big hit when first released, it was not accorded its legendary status by contemporary critics. It is now frequently described as one of the best musicals ever made, topping the AFI&#39;s 100 Years of Musicals list, and ranking fifth in its updated list of the greatest American films in 2007.
Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) is a popular silent film star with humble roots as a singer, dancer, and stunt man. Don barely tolerates his vapid, shallow leading lady, Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), though their studio, Monumental Pictures, links them romantically to increase their popularity. Lina herself is convinced they are in love, despite Don&#39;s protestations otherwise.
One day, to escape from overenthusiastic fans, Don jumps into a passing car driven by Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). She drops him off, but not before claiming to be a stage actress and sneering at his&lt;/p&gt;

Awkward high school sophomore Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Baker (Molly Ringwald) struggles to get through the day of her sixteenth birthday, which her entire family forgets because her older sister, Ginny (Blanche Baker), is getting married the next day. She is also plagued by her ongoing infatuation with the very popular and very attractive senior, Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling). Her day at school fares no better when she finds out that her completed &quot;sex quiz,&quot; which she surreptitiously slipped to her friend, never reached her (and, unbeknownst to either of them, was picked up by Jake Ryan himself). Sam panics as the quiz contains personal information, including the fact that she is a virgin and is saving herself for Jake.
She has a whole new set of problems when she arrives home to find that both sets of grandparents are staying at the Baker home for the duration of the wedding visit. On top of it all, one set of grandparents brings along bizarre foreign exchange student Long Duk Dong (Gedde Watanabe). Sam&#39;s grandparents force&lt;/p&gt;

The screenplay by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Don Marquis, Norman Z. McLeod, and Sam Mintz was based on the comic strip Skippy by Percy Crosby.
The movie starred Jackie Cooper, Robert Coogan, Mitzi Green and Jackie Searl. Director Norman Taurog won the Academy Award for Directing. The film also did well enough to inspire a sequel called Sooky, which is the name of the character Robert Coogan played.
The story involved Skippy&#39;s efforts to help his new friend Sooky. Sooky is played by Jackie Coogan&#39;s brother Robert. In the story Sooky lives in a shantytown.&lt;/p&gt;

It is the first movie released in the Slayers saga.
Sorceresses Lina Inverse and Naga the Serpent take an economy boat trip to the magical disappearing island of Mipross, destroyed by the demon Joyrock many years earlier, so they can enjoy the hot springs there. However the two find that things on Mipross are not quite what they seem. Along the way, they meet an old time-traveling wizard named Rowdy Gabriev, an ancestor of Gourry Gabriev, who aids in defeating Joyrock.
Slayers: The Motion Picture was released in Japan on July 29, 1995. The film was distributed by Toei Animation and was produced by J.C.Staff. It was released to VHS and Laserdisc in North America from A.D. Vision in 1998. The VHS was available in either dubbed or subbed formats, and the Laserdisc was bilingual. A DVD release was compiled later on September 28, 2004 in a remastered disc individually, as part of a movies box set and as part of a Movies &amp;amp; OVAs box set.
A movie soundtrack was released on July 1, 2003&lt;/p&gt;

The film is about the young punk rock fan Steven &quot;Stevo&quot; Levy, a college graduate living in Salt Lake City. The character is portrayed as an exaggerated stereotype of an anarchist punk in the mid 1980s. Many events and characters in the movie are allegedly based on real life, although they may have been exaggerated.
The character of Stevo is based on the life of writer/director James Merendino, although the character is named after Stephen Egerton, originally known as Stephen &quot;Stevo&quot; O&#39;Reilly, who played for the Salt Lake City punk band Massacre Guys, and eventually joined the L.A. bands Descendents and ALL. SLC Punk was chosen as the opening-night feature at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival.
The film outlines the daily lives of two punks in Salt Lake City in the summer of 1985. The film is shot in a documentary, &quot;slice-of-life&quot; style, with frequent voiceovers by Stevo (Matthew Lillard), who narrates the film in past-tense, and his best friend &quot;Heroin&quot; Bob (Michael A. Goorjian). The nickname is ironic, since Bob is afraid of needles and actually believes that any drug (with the&lt;/p&gt;

The film was inspired by An Affair to Remember and used both its theme song and clips from the film in critical scenes. The climactic meeting at the top of the Empire State Building is a reference to a reunion between Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr in An Affair to Remember that fails to happen because the Kerr character is struck by a car while en route. At one point, some of the characters discuss Affair, with Sam commenting that it sounds like a &quot;chick movie.&quot;
Sam Baldwin, a Chicago architect, has lost his wife (Carey Lowell) to cancer. He and his young son Jonah move from Chicago to Seattle to make a fresh start, but Sam is still disconsolate. On Christmas Eve, Jonah calls into a Chicago radio advice show and persuades his father to go on the air with him to talk about how much he misses his wife. Thousands of women around the country, touched by Sam&#39;s story, send him letters. One letter is from Annie Reed, a journalist from Baltimore. Annie is engaged to a nice but sneeze-prone man named&lt;/p&gt;

The Heartland Toy Company is acquired (and renamed Heartland Playsystems) by the multinational conglomerate GloboTech Industries, a division of Gannett Company which is expanding from manufacturing high-quality military hardware. GloboTech CEO, Gil Mars, pays a visit to Heartland to meet with Larry Benson and Irwin Wayfair concerning their newest projects, which involve the creation of intelligent, interactive toys. Irwin introduces the Gorgonites, creatures built for educational purposes, while Larry introduces the Commando Elite, a group of gung-ho supersoldiers. Gil supports Larry&#39;s concept more (having rejected Irwin&#39;s concept when he heard the word &quot;learn&quot; used in his pitch), but complains when he observes a promotional advert for the toys, complaining that the toys cannot actually do what they can do in the advert (e.g. punch a hole through a box), so he tasks Irwin and Larry to develop actual live-action toys capable of &#39;playing back&#39;.

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Smokey and the Bandit is a 1977 American film starring Burt Reynolds, Sally Field, Jackie Gleason, Jerry Reed, Pat McCormick, Paul Williams, and Mike Henry. It inspired several other trucking films, including two sequels, Smokey and the Bandit II (originally known as Smokey and the Bandit Ride Again in the U.K.), and Smokey and the Bandit Part 3. There were also a series of 1994 television movies (Bandit Goes Country, Bandit Bandit, Beauty and the Bandit and Bandit&#39;s Silver Angel) from original director/writer Hal Needham loosely based on the earlier version, with actor Brian Bloom now playing Bandit. The three original movies introduced two generations of the Pontiac Trans Am (while the TV-movie version drives the Dodge Stealth). The film was the second highest grossing film of 1977, beaten only by Star Wars.
As the movie begins, rich Texas wheeler and dealer Big Enos Burdette (Pat McCormick) and his son, Little Enos (Paul Williams), are trying to find a truck driver willing to haul Coors beer to Georgia for their refreshment. Unfortunately, due to federal liquor laws and state liquor tax regulations of the time, selling and/or shipping Coors east of the Mississippi River was&lt;/p&gt;

Set in the London criminal underworld, the film contains two intertwined plots &amp;#8212; one dealing with the search for a stolen diamond, the other with a small-time boxing promoter named Turkish (Jason Statham) who finds himself under the thumb of a sadistic gangster known as Brick Top (Alan Ford).
Snatch is characterized by an assortment of colourful characters, including the &quot;pikey&quot; Irish Traveller Mickey O&#39;Neil (Brad Pitt), Russian-Uzbek ex-KGB agent and arms-dealer Boris &quot;the Blade&quot; Yurinov (Rade Sherbedgia), professional thief and gambling addict Frankie &quot;Four-Fingers&quot; (Benicio del Toro) and bounty hunter Bullet-Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones). It is also distinguished by a kinetic direction and editing style, a circular plot featuring numerous ironic twists of chance and causality, and a fast pace.
The film shares similar themes, ideas and motifs as Ritchie&#39;s first film, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. It is also filmed in the same visual style and features many of the same actors, including Vinnie Jones, Jason Statham and Jason Flemyng, who appears in a minor role as&lt;/p&gt;

Shortly after graduation, he was arrested for cocaine possession and sentenced to three years in prison. His music career began in 1992 after his release when he was discovered by Dr. Dre. He collaborated on several tracks on Dre&#39;s solo debut, The Chronic and on the titular theme song to the film Deep Cover.
Snoop&#39;s debut album, Doggystyle, was released in 1993 under Death Row Records. Doggystyle went quadruple platinum and spawned several hit singles, including &quot;What&#39;s My Name&quot; and &quot;Gin &amp;amp; Juice.&quot; In 1996, Snoop Dogg was cleared of charges over his bodyguard&#39;s 1993 murder of Philip Woldemariam.

Myers plays Charlie McKenzie, a man afraid of commitment until he meets Harriet (Travis), who works at a butcher shop and may be a serial killer. In addition to playing the main character, Myers also plays Charlie&#39;s father, Stuart.
This was Myers&#39; first film after achieving success in the Wayne&#39;s World franchise and was not well received by most mainstream critics or at the box office, grossing a total of USD $11 million in North America, well below its $20 million budget.
Charlie McKenzie (Myers) is a beat poet with Scottish roots and a fear of making a big commitment such as marriage. He even proceeds to create outlandish reasons to break up his relationships (&quot;She smelled like soup&quot;, &quot;she was in the mafia&quot; or &quot;she stole my cat&quot; are some of the memorable reasons). This all changes when Charlie meets Harriet (Travis), a butcher whose first date with Charlie has him assisting Harriet on a busy day at her store. Eventually, Charlie continues to date and ultimately becomes engaged to Harriet. However, upon learning from several sketchy, ambiguous sources (namely the tabloid rag, the Weekly&lt;/p&gt;

Solyaris) (1972), directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, is a meditative psychodrama occurring mostly aboard a space station orbiting the planet Solaris. The scientific mission has stalled, because the scientist crew have fallen to emotional crises. Psychologist Kris Kelvin travels to the Solaris space station, to learn and evaluate the situation &amp;#8212; yet soon hallucinates like the others.
The Polish science fiction novel by Stanis&amp;#322;aw Lem is about the ultimate inadequacy of communication between human and non-human species. Director Tarkovsky&amp;#8217;s Russian film adaptation of the Solaris (1961) novel is a &amp;#8220;drama of grief and partial recovery&amp;#8221; concentrated upon the thoughts and the consciences of the cosmonaut scientists studying an extra-terrestrial (alien) life. The psychologically complex and slow narrative of Solaris has been contrasted to kinetic Western science fiction films, which rely upon fast narrative pace and special effects to communicate character psychology and an imagined future. The ideas which Tarkovsky tried to express in this film are further developed in Stalker.
The critically successful Solaris features Natalya Bondarchuk (Hari), Donatas Banionis&lt;/p&gt;

It is a part of the West Midlands conurbation and is located 9 miles (14.5&amp;#160;km) southeast of Birmingham city centre. It is the largest town in, and administrative centre of, the larger Metropolitan Borough of Solihull which itself has a population of 200,400.
Historically part of Warwickshire, Solihull is one of the most prosperous towns in the English Midlands. Residents of Solihull and those born in the town are referred to as Silhillians. The motto of Solihull is Urbs in Rure (Town in the Country).
Solihull derived its name from a &#39;dirty or muddy&#39; or soily hill which was given by passers-by at the time. The parish church was built on a hill of stiff red marl, which turned to sticky mud in wet weather.
The town has existed since medieval times when it was founded as a market town and it later became an important coaching and mail coach stop. Solihull probably came into being about a thousand years ago, as a clearing in the forest to which people would come to trade. The town is noted for its historic architecture, which includes surviving examples of timber&lt;/p&gt;

It covers a land mass of 28,400&amp;#160;square kilometres (10,965&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi). The capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal.
The Solomon Islands are believed to have been inhabited by Melanesian people for thousands of years. The United Kingdom established a protectorate over the Solomon Islands in 1893. In the Second World War, there was fierce fighting between the Americans and the Japanese in the Solomon Islands campaign of 1942&amp;#8211;45, including the Battle of Guadalcanal. Self-government was achieved in 1976 and independence two years later. The Solomon Islands is a constitutional monarchy with the Queen of the Solomon Islands, at present Elizabeth II, as the head of state.
Since 1998, ethnic violence, government misconduct, and crime have undermined stability and society. In June 2003, an Australian-led multinational force, the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), arrived to restore peace, disarm ethnic militias and improve civil governance.

The film stars Richard Johnson as the detective. Johnson had played the role in the earlier film Deadlier Than the Male (1966). The movie replicated the earlier film&#39;s formula of having Drummond&#39;s nemesis Carl Petersen backed up by two sexy villainesses. This time round, the bad girls were Baroness Helga, played by Daliah Lavi, and Pandora, played by Beba Loncar. Sydne Rome provided back-up for Drummond as a sexy hanger-on named Flicky.
Drummond is hired after a series of inexplicable accidents befall the people and companies who are responsible for developing the world&#39;s first supersonic airliner, the SST1. Drummond, with the help of another agent, uncovers a plot by a mastermind named Carl Petersen, who stands to gain eight million pounds if the aircraft is not ready by a certain date. Petersen has developed a number of robots: beautiful girls with electronic brains to help him sabotage the SST1 project by means of infrasound (sound waves with too low frequency to be detected by the&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Some Kind of Wonderful is a 1987 romance film starring Eric Stoltz, Lea Thompson, and Mary Stuart Masterson. It was one of the many successful teen dramas written by John Hughes in the 1980s, although this one was directed by Howard Deutch. During filming, Deutch met Thompson and two years later the two got married. The film is considered a cult classic of the Brat Pack era due to its strong themes that were seen in previous Hughes productions.
The movie is set against the strict social hierarchy of an American public high school. The tomboyish Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson) has always considered working-class Keith Nelson (Eric Stoltz) her best friend. But when Keith asks out the most popular girl in school, Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson), Watts realizes she feels something much deeper for him. Hardy Jenns (Craig Sheffer), Amanda&#39;s jealous former boyfriend from the rich section of town, still wants her and plans to get back at Keith. Eventually all this is sorted out, with Amanda realizing she needs time alone, and Keith cluing into Watts&#39;s feelings and realizing he loves her, too.
The film was generally well-received by critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that&lt;/p&gt;

The supporting cast includes George Raft, Joe E. Brown, Pat O&#39;Brien and Nehemiah Persoff. The film was adapted by Billy Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond from the story by Robert Thoeren and Michael Logan. Logan had already written the story &amp;#8211; but without the gangsters &amp;#8211; for a German film, Fanfaren der Liebe (directed by Kurt Hoffmann, 1951), so Wilder&#39;s film is considered by some as a remake.
During 1981, after the worldwide success of the French comedy La Cage aux Folles, United Artists re-released Some Like It Hot to theatres. In 2000, the American Film Institute listed Some Like It Hot as the greatest American comedy film of all time.
Two struggling musicians, Joe and Jerry (Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon), witness what looks like the Saint Valentine&#39;s Day massacre of 1929. When the Chicago gangsters, directed by &#39;Spats&#39; Columbo (George Raft), see them, the duo flee for their lives. They escape and decide to leave town, disguising themselves as women to play in an all-girl musical band headed to Florida. Calling themselves Josephine and Geraldine (later&lt;/p&gt;

It was first released in the United States on December 29, 1933 and is regarded as one of Laurel and Hardy&#39;s greatest films. In the UK the film was originally released under the title Fraternally Yours.
The film begins at a meeting of the Sons of the Desert, a fraternal lodge (styled to resemble the Shriners) of which both Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are members. The organisation will be holding its annual convention in Chicago in a week and all members have to take an oath to attend. Stan is reluctant to take the oath, but Oliver goads him into it. Later, on the way home, Stan explains to Oliver his reluctance to take the oath; he is worried that his wife will not let him go to the convention. Oliver tries to reassure Stan that because he took a sacred oath, his wife has no choice but to let him go. When they get home and Stan accidentally brings up the subject of the convention, however, it turns out Oliver&#39;s wife will not let him go as they had already arranged a mountain trip together (which Oliver had forgotten about).

After Nashawn Wade (Kevin Hart) gets his rear end stuck in an airline toilet, the plane suffers a minor disaster and, as a result, his dog is sucked through a jet engine. He then sues the airline and gets a settlement of $100,000,000. He decides to use the money to start his own airline, called NWA/Nashawn Wade Airlines, whose acronym and logo are a pop culture reference to rap group N.W.A. and based on the real airline Northwest Airlines. The airline specifically caters to African Americans and hip hop culture. The terminal at the airport is called the Malcolm X terminal, the plane is a heavily modified 747-200, customized with low-rider hydraulics, spinners, blended winglets for longer range, and a dance club. The safety video is also a spoof of the Destiny&#39;s Child song &quot;Survivor&quot;.

To the north lie Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe; to the east are Mozambique and Swaziland; while Lesotho is an independent country wholly surrounded by South African territory.
Modern humans have inhabited Southern Africa for more than 100,000 years. At the time of European contact, the dominant indigenous peoples were tribes who had migrated from other parts of Africa about one thousand years before. From the 4th-5th century CE, Bantu-speaking tribes had steadily moved south, where they displaced, conquered and assimilated original Khoikhoi and San peoples of southern Africa. At the time of European contact, the two major groups were the Xhosa and Zulu peoples.
In 1652, a century and a half after the discovery of the Cape Sea Route, the Dutch East India Company founded a refreshment station at what would become Cape Town. Cape Town became a British colony in 1806. European settlement expanded during the 1820s as the Boers (original Dutch, Flemish, German and French settlers) and the British 1820 Settlers claimed land in&lt;/p&gt;

The neighborhoods of Tremont and University Heights, Highbridge, Morrisania, Soundview, Hunts Point, and Castle Hill are sometimes considered part of the South Bronx.
The South Bronx is part of New York&#39;s 16th Congressional District, one of the five poorest Congressional Districts in the United States. The South Bronx is served by the NYPD&#39;s 40th, 41st, 42nd, 44th, and 48th Precincts.
The Bronx was once considered the &quot;Jewish Borough,&quot; and at its peak in 1930 was 49% Jewish. Jews in the South Bronx numbered 364,000 or 57.1% of the total population in the area. The term was first coined in the 1940s by a group of social workers who identified the Bronx&#39;s first pocket of poverty, in the Port Morris section, the southernmost section of the Bronx.
After World War II as white flight accelerated and migration of ethnic and racial minorities&lt;/p&gt;

It is a remote and inhospitable collection of islands, consisting of South Georgia and a chain of smaller islands, the South Sandwich Islands. South Georgia is 167.4&amp;#160;kilometres (104.0&amp;#160;mi) long and 1.4 to 37&amp;#160;km (0.87 to 23 miles) wide and is by far the largest island in the territory. The South Sandwich Islands lie about 520&amp;#160;kilometres (320&amp;#160;mi) to the south-east of South Georgia. The total land area of the territory is 3,903&amp;#160;square kilometres (1,507&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi).
There is no native population on any of the islands, and the only present inhabitants are the British Government Officer, Deputy Postmaster, scientists, and support staff from the British Antarctic Survey who maintain scientific bases at Bird Island and at the capital, King Edward Point, as well as museum staff at nearby Grytviken.
The United Kingdom claimed sovereignty over South Georgia in 1775 and the South Sandwich Islands in 1908. In 1908 the United Kingdom annexed both South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The territory of &quot;South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands&quot; was formed in 1985; previously&lt;/p&gt;

The smaller neighborhood around Gloucester Road tube station can also be considered part of South Kensington, as well as the institution area around Exhibition Road, which includes such famous names as the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum, the Royal Albert Hall, Imperial College London, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal College of Art, the Royal College of Music and Baden-Powell House.

It is neighbored by China to the west, Japan to the east, and North Korea to the north. Its capital is Seoul. South Korea lies in a temperate climate region with a predominantly mountainous terrain. Its territory covers a total area of 100,032 square kilometers and has a population of over 50 million.
Archaeological findings show that the Korean Peninsula was occupied by the Lower Paleolithic period. Korean history begins with the founding of Gojoseon in 2333 BC by the legendary Dan-gun. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea under Silla 668 AD, Korea went through the Goryeo Dynasty and Joseon Dynasty as one nation until the end of the Korean Empire in 1910, when Korea was annexed by Japan. After liberation and occupation by Soviet and U.S. forces at the end of World War II, the nation was divided into North and South Korea. The latter was established in 1948 as a democracy. A war between the two Koreas ended in an uneasy cease-fire, and the border between the two nations is&lt;/p&gt;

The South Tarawa population center consists of all the small islets between Bairiki (on the west) to Temaiku/Bonriki on the east. All of several once separate islets are joined by causeways, forming one long islet on the reef along the southern side of the Tarawa Lagoon. There is also a relatively new causeway&amp;#8212;the Japanese Causeway&amp;#8212;that links South Tarawa to Betio, out of South Tarawa. South Tarawa is located at 1&amp;#176;19&#39; North, 172&amp;#176;58&#39; East (1.31667, 172.9667). 
There is a Kiribati Teacher College and a University of the South Pacific campus on South Tarawa. Bairiki is sometimes considered the capital of Kiribati because at one time both the Parliament and the Presidency (and main administrative offices) were located there. The Parliament meets on Ambo islet; various ministries are scattered between South Tarawa, Betio and Christmas Island (ministry of the Line and Phoenix islands).

Much of the population survives on processed food rations, including the eponymous &quot;soylent green&quot;.

It was released on June 24, 1987, and earned only modest returns, but has gone on to become a seminal cult classic on video. Its plot and characters contain numerous parodies of elements primarily from the original Star Wars trilogy, as well as Star Trek and other popular science fiction films.
Planet Spaceball, led by President Skroob (Mel Brooks), has wasted all of its air and, desperate to find more, plans the extraction of all the air from planet Druidia. They plan to kidnap the Druish Princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga), who is about to marry the narcoleptic Prince Valium (Jim J. Bullock). Resenting this marriage, Vespa runs off from the altar with her Droid of Honor, Dot Matrix (Joan Rivers/Lorene Yarnell), and escapes into space, where she is attacked by the Spaceballs under the command of Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis).
Vespa&#39;s father, King Roland (Dick Van Patten), hires Captain Lone Starr (Bill Pullman) and his mawg (half-man, half dog) sidekick Barf (John Candy), who are desperate for money to pay back their debts to the Mafioso Pizza the Hutt (Dom DeLuise), to rescue his daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar; to the north by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the northwest and west by the Atlantic Ocean and Portugal.
Spanish territory also includes the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean, the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean off the African coast, and two autonomous cities in North Africa, Ceuta and Melilla, that border Morocco. With an area of 504,030&amp;#160;km&amp;#178;, Spain is the second largest country in Western Europe and the European Union after France. Since January 1, 2010, Spain has held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
Because of its location, the territory of Spain was subject to many external influences, often simultaneously, since prehistoric times and through the dawn of Spain as a country. Conversely, the country itself has been an important source&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Spanish or Castilian (espa&amp;#241;ol or castellano in Spanish) is a Romance language in the Ibero-Romance group that evolved from several dialects and languages in the northern fringes of the Iberian Peninsula during the 10th century and gradually spread through the Kingdom of Castile, becoming the foremost language for government and trade in the Spanish Empire.
Latin, the basis of all Romance languages including Spanish, was introduced to the Iberian Peninsula by the Romans during the Second Punic War around 210 BC. During the 5th century, Hispania was invaded by Germanic Vandals, Suevi and Visigoths, and other eastern peoples (Alans), resulting in numerous dialects of Vulgar Latin. After the Moorish Conquest in the 8th century, Arabic became an influence in the evolution of Iberian languages including Castilian.
Modern Spanish developed with the Readjustment of the Consonants (Reajuste de las sibilantes) that began in 15th century. The language continues to adopt foreign words from a variety of other languages, as well as developing new words. Castilian was taken most notably to the Americas as well as to Africa and Asia Pacific with the expansion of the Spanish Empire between the&lt;/p&gt;

The film stars Kirk Douglas as rebellious slave Spartacus and Laurence Olivier as his foe, the Roman general and politician Marcus Licinius Crassus. The film also stars Peter Ustinov (who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as slave trader Lentulus Batiatus), John Gavin (as Julius Caesar), Jean Simmons, Charles Laughton, John Ireland, Herbert Lom, Woody Strode, Tony Curtis, John Dall and Charles McGraw. The titles were designed by Saul Bass.
The film begins with slaves working in the Roman province of Libya. Spartacus (Kirk Douglas), a burly Thracian, comes to the aid of an old man who has fallen down. A Roman soldier whips Spartacus and tells him to get back to work, only to be attacked and bitten on the ankle. For this, Spartacus is tied up and sentenced to death by starvation. Lentulus Batiatus (Peter Ustinov), a lanista (an impresario of gladiatorial games), arrives looking for recruits for his gladiatorial establishment. He inspects several slaves before&lt;/p&gt;

Differing from both the film and novel, The Waltons watered down many of the adult themes, including alcoholism and infidelity. Spencer&#39;s Mountain features the majestic scenery of Wyoming&#39;s Grand Teton mountain range, as photographed by cinematographer Charles Lawton in CinemaScope.
The film centers on the trials and tribulations of the Spencers, a Depression-era family living in the Grand Teton Mountains of Wyoming. As the patriarch of a large and growing family, Clay Spencer (Henry Fonda) is fiercely independent, yet dedicated to his family. While he resists the influence of religion, he struggles to remain faithful to his wife Olivia (Maureen O&#39;Hara), to allow his son (James MacArthur) to attend college, and to build a new home for his family.
The movie is set in Wyoming. The book, like &quot;The Waltons&quot;, was set in Virginia. Both the book and the movie were set in the fictitious community of New Dominion, which was based on Earl Hamner&#39;s hometown of&lt;/p&gt;

The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko. He first appeared in Amazing Fantasy #15 (Aug. 1962). Lee and Ditko conceived of the character as an orphan being raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, and as a teenager, having to deal with the normal struggles of youth in addition to those of a costumed crime fighter. Spider-Man&#39;s creators gave him super strength and agility, the ability to cling to most surfaces, shoot spider-webs using devices of his own invention which he called &quot;web-shooters,&quot; and react to danger quickly with his &quot;spider-sense&quot;, enabling him to combat his foes.
When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, a teenage high school student to whose &quot;self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness&quot; young readers could relate. Unlike previous teen heroes such as James Buchanan &quot;Bucky&quot; Barnes and Robin, Spider-Man did not benefit from being the proteg&amp;#233; of any adult mentors like Captain America and Batman,&lt;/p&gt;

The film presents the comic adventures of two novice intelligence agents sent to the Soviet Union. The promotional song from the film, &quot;Spies Like Us&quot;, was composed and performed by Paul McCartney.
The movie was referenced heavily in the song &quot;Out With a Bang&quot; by Self; with even the title being a quote from the film. The song was also used in another Dan Aykroyd film, Evolution.
Dan Aykroyd plays Austin Millbarge, a geekish, basement-dwelling codebreaker for The Pentagon who aspires to escape his under-respected job to become a secret agent. Chase is Emmett Fitz-Hume, a wisecracking, pencil-pushing son of an envoy who takes the foreign service exam under peer pressure. Millbarge and Fitz-Hume meet during the test, on which Fitz-Hume is openly attempting to cheat.
Needing expendable agents to act as decoys to draw attention away from a more capable team, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) decides to enlist the two and promote them to the ranks of GLG20, Foreign Service Operatives, and put them through minimal training, then send them on an undefined&lt;/p&gt;

The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The original music score was composed by Lee Holdridge. It was the very first film released by Touchstone Pictures.
As a boy, Allen Bauer, who does not know how to swim, leaps into the water off Cape Cod after something only he can see. He is rescued from drowning by a young mermaid, and an instant connection forms between the two. When his parents retrieve him, no one sees the mermaid, who weeps at the loss of her new friend before departing. Allen comes to believe the encounter was a near-death hallucination, but his bond with the mermaid proves so strong that his subsequent relationships with women invariably fail as he subconsciously seeks the connection he felt with the mermaid.
Years later, now co-owner with his womanizing brother Freddie of a wholesale fruit and vegetable business in New York City, Allen, depressed after his latest breakup, returns to Cape Cod, where he briefly encounters eccentric scientist Dr. Walter Kornbluth, and again falls into the sea. He wakes up on a beach where&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Spock is a character in the fictional Star Trek media franchise. First portrayed by Leonard Nimoy in the original Star Trek series, Spock also appears in the animated Star Trek series, two episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation, seven of the Star Trek feature films, and numerous Star Trek books, comics, and video games. In the 2009 film Star Trek, Nimoy reprised his role alongside Zachary Quinto, who played a younger, alternate-timeline version of the character, with Jacob Kogan playing Spock as a child. 
Spock (second name unpronounceable by humans and thus never revealed, according to dialogue between Spock and character Leila Kalomi in the original series episode &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;) is the son of Vulcan ambassador Sarek (originally played by Mark Lenard) and human Amanda Grayson (originally played by Jane Wyatt). The relationship between Spock and Sarek is often turbulent, although rooted in an underlying respect and carefully restrained love for each other. Their falling out began when Spock declined an offer to study at the prestigious Vulcan Science Academy and instead joined Starfleet against his father&#39;s wishes.
Spock served on the USS Enterprise for eleven years&lt;/p&gt;

Secret agent WD-40 Dick Steele has his work cut out for him. Along with the mysterious and lovely Veronique Ukrinsky, Agent 3.14, he must rescue the kidnapped Barbara Dahl and stop the evil genius, General Rancor, from seizing control of the entire world.
Rancor was wounded in an earlier encounter and no longer has arms. However, he can &quot;arm&quot; himself by attaching robotic limbs with various weapons attached.
Steele is talked out of retirement by an old friend, agent Steven Bishop, and given his new assignment by The Director, who also is testing out a new variety of disguises. At headquarters, Steele encounters an old agency nemesis, Norm Coleman, and flirts with the Director&#39;s adoring secretary, Miss Cheevus.
On the job, Steele is assisted by Kabul, who gives him rides in a never-ending variety of specially designed cars. They seek help from McLuckey, a small blonde child, home alone, who is very good at fending off intruders.
Steele fights off the temptations of a dangerous woman he finds waiting for him in bed. But he does work very closely&lt;/p&gt;

As a result of its location in the path of major sea routes, Sri Lanka is a strategic naval link between West Asia and South East Asia. It has also been a center of the Buddhist religion and culture from ancient times and is one of the few remaining abodes of Buddhism in South Asia, including Ladakh, Bhutan and the Chittagong Hill Tracts, as well as being a bastion of Hinduism. The Sinhalese community forms the majority of the population; Tamils, who are concentrated in the north and east of the island, form the largest ethnic minority. Other communities include Moors, Burghers, Kaffirs, Malays and the indigenous Vedda people.

The city itself has an estimated population of 354,361 and is the principal municipality of Greater St. Louis, population 2,879,934, the largest urban area in Missouri and 16th-largest in the United States.
The city was founded in 1764 just south of the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers by colonial French traders Pierre Lacl&amp;#232;de and Ren&amp;#233; Auguste Chouteau, who named the settlement after King Louis IX of France. The city, as well as the future state of Missouri, became part of the Spanish Empire after the French were defeated in the Seven Years&#39; War. In 1800, the land was secretly transferred back to France, whose leader, Napoleon Bonaparte, sold it to the United States in 1803. Nicknamed the &quot;Gateway to the West&quot; for its role in the westward expansion of the United States, the city gave the moniker in 1965 to the new Gateway Arch built as part of the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial; the Arch has become the iconic image of St. Louis.

It was adapted from a Broadway play.
Produced and directed by Billy Wilder, it starred William Holden, Don Taylor, Robert Strauss, Neville Brand, Harvey Lembeck, and Peter Graves (Strauss and Lembeck both appeared in the original Broadway production); Wilder also cast Otto Preminger in the role of the evil camp commander.
The movie was adapted by Wilder and Edwin Blum from the Broadway play by Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski who were both prisoners in Stalag XVII-B. (Trzcinski appears in the film as a prisoner.) The play was directed by Jos&amp;#233; Ferrer and was the Broadway debut of John Ericson as Sefton. It began its run in May 1951, continued for 472 performances and was based on the experiences of its authors, both of whom were POWs in Stalag 17B in Austria.

In collaboration with several artists, most notably Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, he co-created Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, the Avengers, Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, and many other fictional characters, introducing complex, naturalistic characters and a thoroughly shared universe into superhero comic books. In addition, he headed the first major successful challenge to the industry&#39;s censorship organization, the Comics Code Authority, and forced it to reform its policies. Lee subsequently led the expansion of Marvel Comics from a small division of a publishing house to a large multimedia corporation.
Lee was born in New York City, New York, in the apartment of his Romanian-born Jewish immigrant parents, Celia (n&amp;#233;e Solomon) and Jack Lieber, at the corner of West 98th Street and West End Avenue in Manhattan.

The phonology of Standard Mandarin is based on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin, a large and diverse group of Chinese dialects spoken across northern and southwestern China. The vocabulary is largely drawn from this group of dialects. The grammar is standardized to the body of modern literary works written in Vernacular Chinese, which in practice follows the same tradition of the Mandarin dialects with some notable exceptions. As a result, Standard Mandarin itself is usually just called &quot;Mandarin&quot; in non-academic, everyday usage. However, linguists use &quot;Mandarin&quot; to refer to the entire language. This convention is adopted in this article.
Standard Mandarin is officially known
In other parts of the world, the three names are used interchangeably to varying degrees, Putonghua being the most common.

He was named a Knight of the Order of the White Eagle . His books have been translated into 41 languages and have sold over 27 million copies. He is perhaps best known as the author of the 1961 novel Solaris, which has twice been made into a feature film. In 1976, Theodore Sturgeon claimed that Lem was the most widely read science-fiction writer in the world.
His works explore philosophical themes; speculation on technology, the nature of intelligence, the impossibility of mutual communication and understanding, despair about human limitations and humankind&#39;s place in the universe. They are sometimes presented as fiction, but others are in the form of essays or philosophical books. Translations of his works are difficult and multiple translated versions of his works exist.
Lem  was born in 1921 in Lw&amp;#243;w, Poland (now Ukraine). He was the son of Sabina Woller and Samuel Lem, a wealthy laryngologist and former physician in the Austro-Hungarian Army. Of Jewish ancestry, he was raised a Roman Catholic and later viewed&lt;/p&gt;

Kubrick was noted for the scrupulous care with which he chose his subjects, his slow method of working, the variety of genres he worked in, his technical perfectionism and his reclusiveness about his films and personal life. He worked far beyond the confines of the Hollywood system, maintaining almost complete artistic control and making movies according to the whims and time constraints of no one but himself, but with the rare advantage of big-studio financial support for all his endeavors. Oscar nominated on several occasions as screenwriter and director, his only personal win was for the special effects in 2001: A Space Odyssey.
Kubrick is widely acknowledged as one of the most accomplished, innovative and influential filmmakers in the history of cinema. He directed a number of highly acclaimed and often controversial films that have often been perceived as a reflection of his obsessive and perfectionist nature. His films are characterized by a formal visual style and meticulous attention to&lt;/p&gt;

Tong is scheduled to appear as a guest judge on the China Beijing TV Station reality television series The Disciple, which is currently airing in Mainland China and is produced by, and features Jackie Chan. The aim of the program is to find a new star, skilled in acting and martial arts, to become Chan&#39;s &quot;successor&quot;, the champion being awarded the lead role in a film. It will conclude on June 7, 2008, with the series winner being announced in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

First Contact is the first film in the franchise to feature no cast members from the original Star Trek television series of the 1960s. The primary cast for First Contact is from the Star Trek: The Next Generation television series, to which the film&#39;s producers added Alice Krige, Neal McDonough, James Cromwell and Alfre Woodard. In the film&#39;s plot, the crew of the USS Enterprise travel from the 24th to 21st century to save their future after the cybernetic Borg conquer Earth by changing the timeline.
After the release of the seventh film, Star Trek Generations, in 1994, Paramount tasked writers Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore with developing a sequel. Braga and Moore wanted to feature the Borg in the plot, while producer Rick Berman wanted a story involving time travel. The writers combined the two ideas; they initially set the film during the European Renaissance, but changed the time period the Borg corrupted to the mid-21st century after fearing the Renaissance idea would be too kitschy. After two better known directors turned down&lt;/p&gt;

It is the first film in the series to star the cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation. It was shot in Overton, Nevada; Paramount Studios; and Lone Pine, California. While the film did reasonably well at the box office, it received mixed reviews from critics.
The story begins with Captain James T. Kirk, recently retired, reluctantly attending the maiden voyage of the USS Enterprise-B in 2293, which is running on a skeleton crew and has several major subsystems still under construction. During the voyage, the Enterprise is pressed into a rescue mission to save two ships from a strange energy ribbon. The Enterprise is able to save some of the El-Aurian refugees, including Dr. Tolian Soran and Guinan before both ships are destroyed, but then becomes trapped in the ribbon itself. Kirk travels to the Engineering decks to alter the behavior of the deflector shields, allowing the Enterprise to escape. The Energy Ribbon makes contact with the engineering hull and causes major damage and while the crew recovers, they find the section that Kirk&lt;/p&gt;

The film is the second feature based on the Star Trek science fiction franchise. The plot features James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and the crew of the starship USS Enterprise facing off against the genetically-engineered tyrant Khan Noonien Singh (Ricardo Montalb&amp;#225;n), a character who first appeared in the 1967 Star Trek television series episode &quot;Space Seed&quot;. When Khan escapes from a 15-year exile to exact revenge on Kirk, the crew of the Enterprise must stop him from acquiring a powerful terraforming device named Genesis. The film concludes with the death of Enterprise crewmember Spock (Leonard Nimoy), beginning a story arc that continues through 1986&#39;s Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.
After the lackluster critical and commercial response to Star Trek: The Motion Picture, series creator Gene Roddenberry was forced out of the sequel&#39;s production. Executive producer Harve Bennett wrote the film&#39;s original outline, which Jack B. Sowards developed into a full script. Director Nicholas Meyer completed the final script in 12 days, without accepting a writing credit. Meyer&#39;s approach evoked the&lt;/p&gt;

After the death of Spock (Leonard Nimoy) during the events of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, the crew of the USS Enterprise returns to Earth. When James T.

The crew must also contend with hostile Klingons, led by Kruge (Christopher Lloyd), bent on stealing the secrets of a powerful terraforming device.
Paramount commissioned the film after positive critical and commercial reaction to The Wrath of Khan. Nimoy directed, the first Star Trek cast member to do so. Producer Harve Bennett wrote the script starting from the end and working back, and intended the destruction of the Enterprise to be a shocking development. Bennett and Nimoy collaborated with effects house Industrial Light &amp;amp; Magic (ILM) to develop storyboards and new ship designs; ILM also handled the film&#39;s many special effects sequences.

It is the fourth feature film based on the Star Trek science fiction television series. It completes the story begun in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and continued in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock. Intent on returning home to Earth to face trial for their crimes, the former crew of the USS Enterprise travels to Earth&#39;s past in order to save their present from a probe attempting to communicate with long-dead humpback whales.
After directing The Search for Spock, cast member Leonard Nimoy was asked to direct the next feature, and given greater freedom to the film&#39;s content. Nimoy and producer Harve Bennett conceived a story with an environmental message. After dissatisfaction with the first script produced by Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes, Paramount hired The Wrath of Khan writer and director Nicholas Meyer, who collaborated with Bennett to rewrite the script. Principal photography started on February 24, 1986, with many real locations used as stand-ins for locations around San Francisco.

It is the tenth feature film in the Star Trek franchise, and the fourth and final film to star the cast from the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation. It follows the mission of the crew of the USS Enterprise-E as they are forced to deal with a threat to the United Federation of Planets from a Reman named Shinzon who has taken control of the Romulan Star Empire in a coup.
Nemesis acted as a swan song for The Next Generation cast, as could be seen from the film&#39;s tagline of &quot;A generation&#39;s final journey begins&quot;. The film was the least commercially successful in the franchise, and was poorly received by the majority of critics.
The film opens on the Romulan Imperial Senate being presented by the military with plans to invade the Federation. The Praetor dismisses the proposal and rebukes the military. Afterward, a senator takes leave of the senate, leaving a small object behind. The object opens, releasing a green mist into the air that covers the room. Moments&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Star Trek: The Motion Picture is a 1979 American science fiction film released by Paramount Pictures. It is the first film based on the Star Trek television series. When a mysterious and immensely powerful alien cloud called V&#39;ger approaches Earth, destroying everything in its path, Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) assumes command of his old starship&amp;#8212;the USS Enterprise&amp;#8212;to lead it on a mission to save the planet and determine V&#39;ger&#39;s origins.
When the original television series was cancelled in 1969, Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry lobbied Paramount to continue the franchise through a film. The success of the series in syndication convinced the studio to begin work on a feature film in 1975. A series of writers attempted to craft a suitably epic script, but the attempts did not satisfy Paramount, so the studio scrapped the project in 1977. Paramount instead planned on returning the franchise to its roots with a new television series, Star Trek: Phase II. The box office success of Close Encounters of the Third Kind convinced Paramount that science fiction films other than Star Wars could do well at the box office, so the studio canceled production of Phase&amp;#160;II and resumed&lt;/p&gt;

The film was directed by William Shatner, following two films directed by his co-star, Leonard Nimoy. Shatner also developed the initial storyline.
The year is 2287, and following the events of Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, the crew of the newly commissioned USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A) is enjoying shore leave, after the starship&#39;s shakedown cruise goes poorly. At Yosemite National Park, Captain James T. Kirk is camping with Spock and Dr. Leonard McCoy. Their leave is interrupted when the Enterprise is ordered by Starfleet Command to rescue human, Klingon and Romulan hostages on the desolate planet of Nimbus III. Learning of the Enterprise&#39;s mission, the Klingon Captain Klaa decides to fight Kirk for personal glory.
Upon arrival at Nimbus III, the Enterprise crew discovers that a renegade Vulcan and Spock&#39;s half-brother, Sybok, is behind the hostage crisis. Sybok reveals that the hostage situation was a ruse to lure a starship to Nimbus III. Sybok wants to use a ship to reach the mythical planet&lt;/p&gt;

It was released in 1991 by Paramount Pictures. It was directed by Nicholas Meyer and written by Meyer with Denny Martin Flinn. After an ecological disaster leads to two longstanding enemies&amp;#8212;the Federation and the Klingon Empire&amp;#8212;brokering a tenuous truce, the crew of the USS Enterprise-A must prevent war from breaking out on the eve of universal peace.
The Undiscovered Country was initially planned as a prequel to the original series, with younger actors portraying the crew of the Enterprise while attending Starfleet Academy, but the idea was discarded because of negative reaction from the cast and the fans. This idea was later used to create the 2009 film, Star Trek. Faced with producing a new film in time for Star Trek&#39;s 25th anniversary, Flinn and Meyer, the director of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, wrote a script based on a suggestion from Leonard Nimoy about what would happen if &quot;the wall came down in space&quot;, touching on the contemporary events of the Cold&lt;/p&gt;

It was the fourth film to be released in the Star Wars saga, the first of a three-film prequel story to the original film trilogy. It was also Lucas&#39; first film as a director in 22 years, and only his fourth overall. The film follows Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who flee the planet Naboo with Queen Amidala in the hope of finding a peaceful end to a trade dispute. Along the way, the ship must stop for repairs on the planet Tatooine, where the Jedi encounter Anakin Skywalker, a young slave boy who is unusually strong with the Force. Meanwhile, they must contend with the mysterious return of the Sith.
Lucas began production when he felt special effects had advanced to the level of what he had envisioned for the film. Shooting took place during 1997 at various locations including Leavesden Film Studios and the Tunisian desert. Special effects made extensive use of computer-generated imagery, with some characters and scenarios being completely digital.
The Phantom Menace was released on May 19, 1999, almost sixteen years after the previous film in the&lt;/p&gt;

It is the fifth film to be released in the Star Wars saga and the second in terms of internal chronology.
The film is set 10 years after the events in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, when the galaxy is on the brink of civil war. Under the leadership of a renegade Jedi named Count Dooku, thousands of planetary systems threaten to secede from the Galactic Republic. When an assassination attempt is made on Senator Padm&amp;#233; Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo, 19-year-old Jedi apprentice Anakin Skywalker is assigned to protect her, while his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi is assigned to investigate the assassination attempt. Soon, Anakin, Padm&amp;#233;, and Obi-Wan are drawn into the heart of the Separatist territories and the beginning of a new threat to the galaxy, the Clone Wars.
Released on May 16, 2002, Attack of the Clones was the first motion picture to be shot completely on a high definition digital 24-frame system and the first Star Wars film to be internationally out-grossed in the year of its original release.
Ten years have passed since the&lt;/p&gt;

The film takes place three years after the onset of the Clone Wars. The Jedi Knights are spread out across the galaxy leading a massive clone army in the war against the Separatists.

Their deepening friendship proves dangerous for the Jedi Order, the galaxy, and Anakin himself.
The film was released in theatres on May 19, 2005 and received generally positive reviews from critics, especially in contrast to the previous two prequels. It broke several box office records during its opening week and went on to earn over $848 million worldwide, making it the second highest grossing film in the Star Wars franchise (not adjusting for inflation).

It is the first of six films released in the Star Wars saga: two subsequent films complete the original trilogy, while a prequel trilogy completes the six film saga. Ground-breaking in its use of special effects, unconventional editing, and sci-fi/fantasy storytelling, the original Star Wars is one of the most successful and influential films of all time.
Set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, the film follows a group of freedom fighters known as the Rebel Alliance who are plotting to destroy the Death Star space station, a powerful device created by the evil Galactic Empire. This conflict disrupts the isolated life of farmboy Luke Skywalker when he inadvertently acquires the droids carrying the stolen Death Star plans. When the Empire begins a cruel and destructive search for the droids, Skywalker decides to accompany Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi on a daring mission to rescue the owner of the droids, rebel leader Princess Leia Organa, and save the galaxy.
Produced with a budget of $11 million and released on May 25, 1977, the film went&lt;/p&gt;

The screenplay, based on a story by George Lucas, was written by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan. It was the second film released in the Star Wars saga, and the fifth in terms of internal chronology.
The film is set three years after the destruction of the Death Star. The villainous Darth Vader and the elite forces of the Galactic Empire are in pursuit of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, and the rest of the Rebel Alliance. While Vader chases Han and Leia across the galaxy, Luke studies the Force under Jedi Master Yoda. Vader uses Luke&#39;s friends to set a trap for him, leading to a fierce confrontation between the black-armored Sith and the young Jedi which ends with a shocking revelation.
Following a difficult production, The Empire Strikes Back was released on May 21, 1980, and initially received mixed reviews from critics, although it has since grown in esteem, becoming one of the most popular chapters in the Star Wars saga and one of the most highly rated films in history. It earned more than US$538 million worldwide over the original run and several&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Stardust Memories is a 1980 film written and directed by Woody Allen, who considers this to be one of his best films in addition to The Purple Rose of Cairo and Match Point. The film is shot in black-and-white, particularly reminiscent of Federico Fellini&#39;s 8&amp;#189; (1963), which it parodies. It was nominated for a Writers Guild of America award for &quot;Best Comedy written directly for screen&quot;.
It is the story of a famous filmmaker Sandy Bates (Allen), who is plagued by fans who prefer his &quot;earlier, funnier movies&quot; to his more recent artistic efforts, while he tries to reconcile his conflicting attraction to two very different women: the earnest, intellectual Daisy (Jessica Harper), and the more maternal Isobel (Marie-Christine Barrault). Meanwhile, he is also haunted by memories of his ex-girlfriend, the mercurial Dorrie (Charlotte Rampling).
The conflict between the maternal, nurturing woman and the earnest, usually younger one, is a recurring theme in Allen&#39;s films. Like many of Allen&#39;s films, Stardust Memories incorporates several jazz recordings including those by such notables as Louis Armstrong, Django Reinhardt, and Chick Webb. The film&#39;s title alludes to the famous alternate take&lt;/p&gt;

The film stars Ben Stiller as David Starsky and Owen Wilson as Ken &quot;Hutch&quot; Hutchinson and is a spoof adaptation of the original television series of the same name from the 1970s.
Two streetwise undercover cops in 1975, driving in a red 1975 Ford Gran Torino, bust drug criminals with the help of underworld player, Huggy Bear. The film functions as a sort of prequel to the TV series, as it portrays when Starsky was first partnered with Hutchinson. The film also switches the personalities of the title characters. While in the TV show, Starsky was curious and streetwise, and Hutch was very laid back and by-the-book. In the film, Starsky is the serious cop, and Hutch is laid-back. There are four Frat Pack members in this film, although not all are in major roles.
The movie takes place in the fictional city of Bay City, California in 1975. The story centers around two cops who work for the Bay City Police Department. The city has a distinctly southern California atmosphere to it and Bay City is very similar to Los Angeles. The two cops are, David Starsky (Ben Stiller) a loudmouth, wannabe macho cop that loves his&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Steamboat Willie (1928) is an animated short released on November 18, 1928. It was the third Mickey Mouse cartoon, behind Plane Crazy (released six months earlier) and The Gallopin&#39; Gaucho (made earlier, but released after). It was also the first Disney cartoon to feature synchronized sound. Disney used Pat Powers&#39; Cinephone system, created by Powers using Lee De Forest&#39;s Phonofilm system without giving De Forest any credit. Steamboat Willie premiered at New York&#39;s 79th Street Theatre, and played ahead of the independent feature film Gang War. Steamboat Willie was an immediate hit while Gang War is all but forgotten today.
The cartoon was directed by Walt Disney. The title is a parody of the Buster Keaton film Steamboat Bill Jr. Music for Steamboat Willie was put together by Wilfred Jackson, one of Disney&#39;s animators&amp;#8212;not, as sometimes reported, by Carl Stalling&amp;#8212;and comprises popular melodies including &quot;Steamboat Bill&quot; and &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot;.
It is noted in the history books as the first animated short feature film with a completely post-produced soundtrack of music, dialogue, and sound effects, although other cartoons with synchronized soundtracks had been exhibited before,&lt;/p&gt;

The film was released in Japan on July 17, 2004. With an initial production cost of US$26,000,000, Steamboy is the most expensive full length Japanese animated movie made to date. Additionally, the film was in production for ten years and utilized more than 180,000 drawings and 440 CG cuts.
In keeping with the steampunk subgenre of science fiction, the movie employs alternate history: it is set in a 19th-century context, yet it features several geopolitical and industrial circumstances that developed differently or at a different pace, sometimes as a result of advanced technological paradigms that were accomplished via the science already present in the 19th century.
The Admiral
In 1863, scientist Lloyd Steam and his son Edward have succeeded, after a lengthy expedition, in discovering a pure mineral water. They believe the water can be harnessed as an ultimate power source using steam engines (the main industrial engine of the time).

He was inducted into the comics industry&#39;s Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1990, and into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994.
Stephen J. Ditko was born in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, the son of first-generation Americans of Czechoslovakian descent: Stephen Ditko, an artistically talented master carpenter at a steel mill, and Anna, a homemaker. The second-eldest child in a working-class family, he was preceded by sister Anna Marie and followed in uncertain order by sister Betty and brother Patrick. Inspired by his father&#39;s love of newspaper comic strips, particularly Hal Foster&#39;s Prince Valiant, Ditko found his interest in comics accelerated by the introduction of superhero Batman in 1940, and by Will Eisner&#39;s The Spirit, which appeared in a tabloid-sized comic-book insert in Sunday newspapers.
Good with his hands, Ditko in junior high school was part of a group of students who crafted wooden models of German airplanes to aid civilian World War II aircraft-spotters. Upon graduating from Johnstown High&lt;/p&gt;

It is the major settlement in the unitary authority area and borough of Stockton-on-Tees. For ceremonial purposes, the borough is split between County Durham and North Yorkshire as it also incorporates a number of smaller towns including Billingham, Yarm and Thornaby. The combined size of the borough equates to approx 180,000 people and makes it larger than Middlesbrough in terms of population and area.
Stockton began as an Anglo-Saxon settlement on high ground close to the northern bank of the River Tees.
The manor of Stockton was created in around 1138. It was purchased by Bishop Pudsey of Durham in 1189 and since then has undergone many changes.
Stockton&#39;s market can trace its history back to 1310, when Bishop Bek of Durham granted a market charter - to our town of Stockton a market upon every Wednesday for ever.
Stockton Castle is first referred to in 1376. It was captured by the Scots in 1644 and was occupied by them until 1646, but was destroyed on the orders of Oliver Cromwell at the end of the Civil War. There is now a shopping centre, called the Castlegate Centre, where the original castle stood. There are no known&lt;/p&gt;

After the phenomenal success of What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962), Joan Crawford and other actresses, including Bette Davis and Barbara Stanwyck, made numerous horror movies throughout the 1960s. Strait-Jacket is one of the more notable examples of the genre sometimes referred to as psycho-biddy or Grande Dame Guignol. When the film opened, moviegoers were given little cardboard axes.
After a 20-year stint in a psychiatric hospital for the decapitation axe-murder of her philandering husband, Lucy Harbin takes up residence at the farm of her brother Bill Cutler and sister-in-law Emily. Lucy&#39;s adult daughter Carol also lives on the Cutler farm and is seemingly unaffected by the grisly murders she witnessed many years in the past as a three year-old child.
Carol encourages her&lt;/p&gt;

Max von Sydow co-stars.
Most of the film was shot in the Southern Ontario area. Toronto, Scarborough, Kitchener, and Hamilton were the main locations. Parts of the movie were also filmed in Prince George, British Columbia.
It begins like a typical Great White North sketch on SCTV, but then cuts away to the story. Two unemployed brothers, Bob (Moranis) and Doug (Thomas) McKenzie, are in a bind when they give away their father&#39;s beer money and then run out of beer. The brothers place a mouse in a beer bottle in an attempt to get free Elsinore beer from the local beer store, but are told to take up the matter at the Elsinore brewery instead. After presenting the evidence to management at Elsinore brewery, the brothers are given jobs on the bottling line inspecting the bottles for mice. They take this opportunity to drink lots of free beer off the line; later, they surprise their parents with a van full of Elsinore products.
Meanwhile, the evil Brewmeister Smith (von Sydow) is perfecting a&lt;/p&gt;

It was one of Canadian comedian John Candy&#39;s early breakthrough film appearances. Dave Thomas, Bill Paxton and Timothy Busfield are also in one scene apiece. The film was among Oates&#39; last films, as he died of a heart attack the year after it was released.
John Winger is a slacker in his late 20s (played by Bill Murray, age 31) who drives a cab in Louisville. He experiences the worst day of his life as, in the span of just a few hours, he quits his job, his car is repossessed, he drops his pizza on the street, and his girlfriend dumps him. Realizing that his life is a failure, he decides he needs a new direction.

The film was directed by Andrew Bergman. Based on the book Strip Tease by Carl Hiaasen, it is about a stripper who becomes involved in both a child custody dispute and corrupt politics.
Striptease was generally reviled by critics. The film wound up winning several Golden Raspberry Awards (Razzies), which are given to the worst in cinema. Among these awards given to Striptease was the Razzie Award for Worst Picture of 1996.
The film revolves around Erin Grant (Moore), a former FBI secretary, who loses custody of her young daughter Angela to her ex-husband Darrell. In order to afford an appeal, Erin becomes a stripper at the Eager Beaver, a Miami strip club. A Congressman named David Dilbeck (Reynolds) visits the club and immediately begins to adore Grant. Aware of Dilbeck&#39;s embarrassing indulgences, another Eager Beaver patron approaches Erin with a plan to manipulate the Congressman to settle the custody dispute in Erin&#39;s favour. However, Dilbeck has powerful business connections who want to ensure he remains in office. Consequently, those who can embarrass him in an election are murdered.&lt;/p&gt;

The church of St Mary&#39;s was built in the eleventh century.
The village also gives its name to the Sturmer Pippin apple which was bred in the orchards of the village.
Like most English villages Sturmer once had industry of its own including shops, maltings, farming, orchards (for both apples and willow for basket making &amp;amp; cricket bats). Today, in common with many other villages, there is little of this local industry left. It is home to a golf course, cement works, a nursery/garden centre and most of the village area is still covered with worked arable land although it takes many fewer people to run an arable farm than it did in the 1800s.
The village was once host to a railway station and hotel on Water Lane but both are now private dwellings. The Stour Valley Railway once connected Sturmer to Colchester, Cambridge, Sudbury and many other important towns but was eventually closed as part of the Beeching Axe which shut many branch lines.
One of the previous incumbents of Sturmer was the father of actress Charlotte Rampling, who was born in Sturmer. In the Old English poem&lt;/p&gt;

It is the county seat of Sucha County. It has been in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship since 1999; previously it was in Bielsko-Bia&amp;#322;a Voivodeship (1975&amp;#8211;1998).
The town flourished towards the end of the 19th century after it became a major railway junction, with routes to Krak&amp;#243;w, Zakopane and &amp;#379;ywiec.
Since the beginning of the 20th century Sucha Beskidzka has been a tourist centre for the Beskidy Mountains (part of the Carpathians).
In the town there are fine examples of old architecture: a Renaissance castle (16th cent.), named Little Wawel after the royal palace in Krak&amp;#243;w; a church with a cloister (17th cent.); and an old wooden inn, called Rzym (Rome) (18th cent.).

Located in the south-central part of the country, Sucre lies at an altitude of 2750m (9,000&amp;#160;ft). Its lower altitude gives the city a warm temperate climate year-round.
On November 30, 1538, Sucre was founded under the name Ciudad de la Plata de la Nueva Toledo by Pedro Anzures, Marqu&amp;#233;s de Campo Redondo. In 1538, the Spanish King Philip II established the Audiencia de Charcas in La Plata with authority over an area which covers what is now Paraguay, southeastern Peru, Northern Chile and Argentina, and much of Bolivia. The Audiencia de Charcas was a subdivision of the Viceroyalty of Peru. In 1601, the Recoleta Monastery was founded by the Franciscans and in 1609, an archbishopric was founded in the city. In 1624, St Francis Xavier University of Chuquisaca was founded.
Very much a Spanish city during the colonial era, the narrow streets of the city centre are organised in a grid, reflecting the Andalusian culture that is embodied in the architecture of the city&#39;s great houses and numerous convents and churches. Sucre remains the seat of the Roman Catholic Church&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Sunderland (pronounced /&amp;#712;s&amp;#652;nd&amp;#602;l&amp;#601;nd/&amp;#160;( listen) or local /&amp;#712;s&amp;#650;n(d)l&amp;#601;n/) lies at the heart of the City of Sunderland, a metropolitan borough of Tyne and Wear, in North East England. It is situated at the mouth of the River Wear.
The name &quot;Sunderland&quot; is reputed to come from Soender-land (soender/sunder being the Anglo-Saxon infinitive, meaning &quot;to part&quot;, (cf. &quot;(a)sunder&quot;), likely to be reference to the valley carved by the River Wear on whose South bank the original settlement of Sunderland was founded.
Historically a part of County Durham, there were three original settlements on the site of modern-day Sunderland. On the north side of the river, Monkwearmouth was settled in 674 when Benedict Biscop founded the Wearmouth-Jarrow monastery. Opposite the monastery on the south bank, Bishopwearmouth was founded in 930. A small fishing village called Sunderland, located toward the mouth of the river (modern day East End) was granted a charter in 1179.
Over the centuries, Sunderland grew as a port, trading coal and salt. Ships began to be built on the river in the 14th century. By the 19th century, the port of Sunderland had grown to absorb Bishopwearmouth and Monkwearmouth.

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Sunshine is a 2007 American/British science fiction film directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland about the crew of a spacecraft on a dangerous mission to the Sun. In 2057, with the Earth in peril from the dying Sun, the crew is sent to reignite the Sun with a massive stellar bomb, a nuclear device with the equivalent mass of Manhattan Island. The crew is made up of an ensemble cast consisting of Cillian Murphy, Chris Evans, Rose Byrne, Michelle Yeoh, Cliff Curtis, Troy Garity, Hiroyuki Sanada, Benedict Wong, Chipo Chung, and Mark Strong.
The script was based on a scientific back-story that took the characters on a psychological journey. The director cast a group of international actors for the film, and had the actors live together and learn about topics related to their roles, as a form of method acting. To have the actors realistically react to visual effects that would be implemented in post-production, the filmmakers constructed live sets to serve as cues.
Previous science fiction films that Boyle cited as influences included Kubrick&#39;s 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, the 1972 Tarkovsky&#39;s Solaris, and the 1979 science-fiction horror film Alien. Sunshine was released&lt;/p&gt;

The film was written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who began working on the script when they were both thirteen years old; they completed a draft by the time they were fifteen. The film&#39;s main characters have the same given names as Rogen and Goldberg. The film was one of a string of hits by Judd Apatow.
It is two weeks before the end of high school. Evan (Michael Cera) and Seth (Jonah Hill) are long-time friends in their senior year of high school, about to leave for different colleges. Their mutual friend, Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), has plans to acquire a fake ID, so Seth agrees to buy alcohol for a party that his crush, Jules (Emma Stone), is hosting. Evan also offers to buy Goldslick vodka for his long-time crush Becca (Martha MacIsaac).
While purchasing the alcohol Fogell is assaulted by a hooded robber, and the police soon arrive. The two officers, Michaels (Seth Rogen) and Slater (Bill Hader), appear to be fooled by Fogell&#39;s fake ID (which has the single name &quot;McLovin&quot; as his identity) and offer Fogell a lift to the party. On the way, however, they make&lt;/p&gt;

Spurlock&#39;s film follows a 30-day time period (February to beginning of March 2003) during which he eats only McDonald&#39;s food. The film documents this lifestyle&#39;s drastic effects on Spurlock&#39;s physical and psychological well-being, and explores the fast food industry&#39;s corporate influence, including how it encourages poor nutrition for its own profit. Spurlock dined at McDonald&#39;s restaurants three times per day, eating every item on the chain&#39;s menu. He also always &quot;super-sized&quot; his meal&amp;#8212;but only if it was offered. Spurlock consumed an average of 20.92 megajoules or 5,000 kcal (the equivalent of 9.26 Big Macs) per day during the experiment. As a result, the then-32-year-old Spurlock gained 24&amp;#189; lbs. (11.1&amp;#160;kg), a 13% body mass increase, a cholesterol level of 230, and experienced mood swings, sexual dysfunction, and fat accumulation to his liver. It took Spurlock fourteen months to lose the weight gained from his experiment.
The reason for Spurlock&#39;s investigation was the increasing spread of obesity throughout U.S. society, which the Surgeon General has&lt;/p&gt;

It stars the voices of Shia LaBeouf, Jeff Bridges, Zooey Deschanel, Jon Heder among others.
It was Sony Pictures Animation&#39;s second theatrical feature. The American premiere occurred on June 8, 2007. It is directed by Ash Brannon (the co-director of Toy Story 2) and Chris Buck (the director of Tarzan). Pre-production for Surf&#39;s Up began in 2002.
It is a parody of surfing documentaries, such as The Endless Summer and Riding Giants, with parts of the plot parodying North Shore. Real-life surfers Kelly Slater and Rob Machado have vignettes as their penguin surfer counterparts. To obtain the desired hand-held documentary feel, the film&#39;s animation team motion-captured a physical camera operator&#39;s moves.
A documentary crew follows the events of Cody Maverick (voiced by Shia LaBeouf) a small rockhopper penguin residing in Shiverpool, Antarctica (a pun on Liverpool, England). After a childhood visit from surf legend Zeke &quot;Big Z&quot; Topanga, Cody aspires to emulate the renowned legend by becoming a famous and respected surfer.

Suva is Fiji&#39;s political and administrative capital and home to almost half of the country&#39;s population.

The nation, as well as its people, are named after the 19th century king Mswati II.
Swaziland is a small country, no more than 200&amp;#160;km north to south and 130&amp;#160;km east to west. The western half is mountainous, descending to a lowveld region to the east. The eastern border with Mozambique and South Africa is dominated by the escarpment of the Lebombo Mountains. The climate is temperate in the west, but may reach 40 degrees in summer in the lowveld. Rainfall occurs mainly in the summer and may reach 2 m in the west.
The area that Swaziland now covers has been continuously inhabited since prehistory. Today, the population is primarily ethnic Swazis whose language is Swati, though English is spoken as a second language. The Swazi people descend from the southern Bantu who migrated from Central Africa in the 15th and 16th centuries. The Anglo Boer war saw Britain make Swaziland a protectorate under its direct control. Swaziland gained independence in 1968. Swaziland is a member of the Southern&lt;/p&gt;

They&#39;ve come to the beach to unearth sand that has been struck by lightning, molding it into beautiful glass shapes. The two discuss their future together, and Jake very self-assuredly says they&#39;ll be married one day. When asked why he would want to marry Melanie, Jake replies &quot;So I can kiss you anytime I want&quot;. They kiss, but are then struck by lightning. The scene then moves to the present day. Melanie has changed her last name to &quot;Carmichael&quot; lost her southern accent and is now a successful fashion designer in New York City. When she becomes engaged to Andrew, the son of the mayor of New York City, Melanie announces that she has to go back home alone to Alabama to tell her parents in person. Her private reason is to demand a divorce from Jake. She has not told Andrew that she is still married.

Buddy Ackerman, an influential movie mogul, hires a young man as his assistant. Guy, who has just graduated from film school, believes that his new job is a golden opportunity. Despite warnings from Rex, the outgoing assistant who has become hardened under Buddy&#39;s reign, Guy remains optimistic.
Unfortunately, Buddy turns out to be the boss from hell; he treats Guy like a slave, subjects him to sadistic (and public) verbal abuse, and has him bending over backwards to do meaningless errands. Guy is humiliated and forced to bear the brunt of his insults. His only solace is his girlfriend, Dawn, a producer at Buddy&#39;s firm. When Buddy apparently fires Guy in a phone call, Guy snaps and kidnaps Buddy in order to exact some revenge, which results in tying up Buddy and subjecting him to severe beatings, torture and paper cutting Buddy on his face and dumping salt and hot sauce on the wounds. It is later revealed that due to a botched call waiting function on Buddy&#39;s home phone, Guy hears Buddy and Dawn arranging a rendezvous at Buddy&#39;s house.

Sidney, born Sophia Kosow in The Bronx, New York, was the daughter of Rebecca (n&amp;#233;e Saperstein), a Romanian Jew, and Victor Kosow, a Russian Jewish immigrant who worked as a clothing salesman. Her parents divorced by 1915 and she was adopted by her stepfather, Sigmund Sidney, a dentist. Sidney became an actress at the age of fifteen as a way of overcoming shyness, using her stepfather&#39;s surname as her professional surname. As a student of the Theater Guild&#39;s School for Acting, Sidney appeared in several of their productions during the 1920s and earned praise from theater critics. In 1926, she was seen by a Hollywood talent scout and made her first film appearance later that year.
During the Depression, Sidney appeared in a string of films, often playing the girlfriend or the sister of a gangster. She appeared opposite such heavyweight screen idols as Spencer Tracy, Henry Fonda, Joel McCrea, Fredric March, George Raft (a frequent screen partner), and Cary Grant. Among her films from this period were: An American Tragedy, City Streets and Street Scene (all 1931), Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s Sabotage and Fritz Lang&#39;s Fury&lt;/p&gt;

Today, Syracuse is located at the intersection of Interstates 81 and 90, and its airport is the largest in the region. Syracuse is home to Syracuse University, a major research university, as well as several smaller colleges and professional schools.

Situated at the tip of northern Taiwan, Taipei is located on the Danshui River, and is about 25&amp;#160;km southwest of Keelung, its port on the Pacific Ocean. Another coastal city, Danshui, is about 20&amp;#160;km northwest at the river&#39;s mouth on the Taiwan Strait. It lies in the two relatively narrow valleys of the Keelung (&amp;#22522;&amp;#38534;&amp;#27827;) and Xindian (&amp;#26032;&amp;#24215;&amp;#28330;) rivers, which join to form the Danshui River along the city&#39;s western border. The city proper (Taipei City) is home to an estimated 2,619,920 people (March 2009). Taipei City, Taipei County, and Keelung City together form the Taipei metropolitan area with a population of 6,752,826 (March 2009). However, they are administered under different local government bodies. &quot;Taipei&quot; sometimes refers to the whole metropolitan area, while &quot;Taipei City&quot; refers to the city proper.

Separated from the Asian continent by the 120&amp;#160;kilometres (75&amp;#160;mi) wide Taiwan Strait, the main island of the group is 394&amp;#160;kilometres (245&amp;#160;mi) long and 144&amp;#160;kilometres (89&amp;#160;mi) wide. To the northeast are the main islands of Japan, and the southern end of the Ryukyu Islands of Japan is directly to the east; the Philippines lie to its south. The mountainous island spans the Tropic of Cancer and is covered by tropical and subtropical vegetation. Other minor islands and islets of the group include the Pescadores, Green Island, and Orchid Island as well as the Diaoyutai Islands which have been controlled by Japan since the 1970s and are known as the Senkaku-shot&amp;#333;.
The island group has been governed by the Republic of China since 1945 when the ROC acquired Taiwan from Japan as a result of World War II. Four years later the ROC lost the Chinese Civil War to the Communist Party of China and retreated to Taiwan. Taiwan now composes most of ROC&#39;s&lt;/p&gt;

He was born in Ikuno, Hyogo, Japan.
His debut as actor was the film Akanishi Kakita (&amp;#36196;&amp;#35199;&amp;#34851;&amp;#22826;; Capricious Young Man, 1936) and cast in the Kenji Mizoguchi&#39;s film Osaka Elegy (&amp;#28010;&amp;#33775;&amp;#24754;&amp;#27468;, 1936).
In company with Toshir&amp;#333; Mifune, Shimura is the actor who is most closely associated with Akira Kurosawa. Shimura appeared in more than twenty of Kurosawa&#39;s films. His roles include the doctor in Drunken Angel (1948), the veteran detective in Stray Dog (1949), the flawed lawyer in Scandal (1950), the woodcutter in Rashomon (1950), the mortally ill bureaucrat in Ikiru (1952), the lead samurai Kambei in Seven Samurai (1954).
In fact, Kurosawa&#39;s cinematic collaboration with Shimura, from 1943 to 1980, started earlier and lasted longer than his work with Mifune (1948-65). Shimura appeared in the director&#39;s debut film Sanshiro Sugata (1943), and the last film of Kurosawa&#39;s in which he acted was Kagemusha (1980), for which Kurosawa specifically wrote a part for Shimura. However, the scene was cut from the western release, and so many did not know that he had been part of the film. The DVD release of the film by&lt;/p&gt;

It is situated on the northern coast of the country, on the banks of the Gulf of Finland, 80&amp;#160;km (50&amp;#160;mi) south of Helsinki.
In 1154 a town called Qlwn or Qalaven (possible derivations of Kalevan or Kolyvan) was put on the world map of the Almoravid by cartographer Muhammad al-Idrisi who described it as a small town like a large castle among the towns of Astlanda. It has been suggested that the Quwri in Astlanda may have denoted the predecessor town of today&#39;s Tallinn.
The earliest names of Tallinn include Kolyvan (Russian: &amp;#1050;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1083;&amp;#1099;&amp;#1074;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1085;&amp;#1100;) known from East Slavic chronicles, the name possibly deriving from the Estonian mythical hero Kalev.

The country&#39;s eastern borders lie on the Indian Ocean.
The United Republic of Tanzania is a unitary republic composed of 26 mikoa (regions). The current head of state is President Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, elected in 2005. Since 1996, the official capital of Tanzania has been Dodoma, where parliament and some government offices are located. Between independence and 1996 the major coastal city of Dar es Salaam had been the country&#39;s political capital. Today Dar es Salaam remains the principal commercial city of Tanzania and the de-facto seat of most government institutions. It is the major seaport for the country and its landlocked neighbours.
The name Tanzania is a portmanteau of Tanganyika and Zanzibar. The two states united in 1964 to form the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar, which later the same year was renamed the United Republic of Tanzania.

The city covers an area of 726&amp;#160;km&amp;#178; (280.3 square miles) and has 1,480,000 inhabitants.
Founded in the 5th century AD by Vakhtang Gorgasali, the Georgian King of Kartli (Iberia), and made into a capital in the 6th century, Tbilisi is a significant industrial, social, and cultural center. The city is also emerging as an important transit route for global energy and trade projects. Located strategically at the crossroads between Europe and Asia and lying along the historic Silk Road routes, Tbilisi has often been the point of contention between various rivaling powers and empires. The history of the city can be seen by its architecture, where the Haussmannized Rustaveli Avenue and downtown are blended with the narrower streets of the medieval Narikala district.

Tegucigalpa is also the capital of Honduras&#39;s Francisco Moraz&amp;#225;n department.
Tegucigalpa was founded by Spanish settlers as Real Villa de San Miguel de Heredia de Tegucigalpa on September 29, 1578 on the site of an existing native settlement. Before and after independence, the city was a mining center for silver and gold. The capital of the independent Republic of Honduras switched back and forth between Tegucigalpa and Comayagua until it was permanently settled in Tegucigalpa in 1880.
A popular myth claims that the society of Comayagua, the long-time colonial capital of Honduras, publicly disliked the wife of President Marco Aurelio Soto, who took revenge by moving the capital to Tegucigalpa. A more likely theory is that the change took place because President Soto was an important partner of the Rosario Mining Company, an American silver mining company, whose operations were based in San Juancito, close to Tegucigalpa, and he needed to be close to his personal interests.

The Australian mandate was based on the previous German New Guinea, which was captured and occupied by Australian forces in 1914, during World War I.

It is located at the north-east of the Caribbean Sea in the Atlantic Ocean north of Cuba, Hispaniola (Dominican Republic and Haiti) and the Caribbean Sea, northwest of the Turks and Caicos Islands, and southeast of the United States of America (nearest to the state of Florida). Its total land area is almost 14&amp;#160;000&amp;#160;km&amp;#178;, with an estimated population of 330,000. Its capital is Nassau.
Originally inhabited by Arawakan Taino people, The Bahamas were the site of Columbus&#39; first landfall in the New World in 1492. Although the Spanish never colonised The Bahamas, they shipped the native Lucayans (as the Bahamian Taino settlers referred to themselves) to slavery in Hispaniola. The islands were mostly deserted from 1513 to 1650, when British colonists from Bermuda settled on the island of Eleuthera.
The Bahamas became a Crown Colony in 1718 when the British clamped down on piracy. Following the American War of Independence, thousands of pro-British loyalists and enslaved Africans moved to The Bahamas and set up a&lt;/p&gt;

It is also, as Bronx County, the newest of the 62 counties of New York State. Located north of Manhattan and Queens, and south of Westchester County, the Bronx is the only borough not primarily located on an island. In 2009, the Census Bureau estimated that the borough&#39;s population on July 1, 2008 was 1,391,903, inhabiting a land area of 42 square miles (109 square kilometers). This makes the Bronx the fourth-most-populated of the five boroughs, the fourth-largest in land area, and the third-highest in density of population.
The Bronx is divided by the Bronx River into a hillier section in the west, closer to Manhattan, and the flatter East Bronx, closer to Long Island. The West Bronx was annexed to New York City (then largely confined to Manhattan) in 1874, and the areas east of the Bronx River in 1895. The Bronx first assumed a distinct legal identity when it became a borough of Greater New York in 1898. Bronx County, with the same boundaries as the borough, was separated from New York County (afterwards coextensive with the Borough of Manhattan) as of January 1, 1914.

The Gambia is the smallest country on mainland Africa, bordered to the north, east, and south by Senegal, with a small coast on the Atlantic Ocean in the west.
Its borders roughly correspond to the path of the Gambia River, the nation&#39;s namesake, which flows through the country&#39;s center and empties into the Atlantic Ocean. Its size is almost 10,500&amp;#160;km&amp;#178; with an estimated population of	1,700,000.
On 18 February 1965, The Gambia was granted independence from the United Kingdom and joined The Commonwealth. Banjul is The Gambia&#39;s capital, but the largest conurbation is Serekunda.
The Gambia shares historical roots with many other west African nations in the slave trade, which was key to the establishment of a colony on the Gambia river, first by the Portuguese and later by the British. Since gaining independence in 1965, The Gambia has enjoyed relative stability, with the exception of a brief period of military rule in 1994.
An agriculturally rich country, its economy is dominated by farming, fishing, and tourism. About a third of the population live&lt;/p&gt;

The Valley has few examples of colonial architecture due to the relocation of Anguilla&#39;s administration to St. Kitts in 1825, though Wallblake House, built in 1787, still stands and is used as a rectory by the adjacent church. New shops have opened in new buildings and renovated West Indian-style cottages. Old shops have been modernized and have enlarged their stocks as well as their space.
The ruins of the Old Court House are located on Crocus Hill, the island&#39;s highest point. All that remains are the broken walls of a few basement jail cells. At Cross Roads at the western edge of The Valley is Wallblake House, a plantation home built around 1787 that is now owned by the Catholic Church (the parish priest lives there) and St. Gerard&#39;s Catholic Church, with its highly original facade of pebbles, stones, cement, wood and tile.

Maguire was born in Santa Monica, California, the son of Wendy (n&amp;#233;e Brown), a secretary turned screenwriter and producer, and Vincent Maguire, a construction worker and cook.

His mother offered him US$100 to take a drama class instead, and Tobey agreed.
The nomadic nature of his school-age years began to take a toll on Maguire emotionally, and finally, after a relocation to yet another school, Maguire dropped out of high school his freshman year and never returned, deciding to focus himself on his blossoming acting career.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, McFarlane became a comic book superstar due to his work on Marvel Comics&#39; Spider-Man franchise. In 1992, he helped form Image Comics, pulling the occult anti-hero character Spawn from his high school portfolio and updating him for the 1990s.

In September, 2006, it was announced that McFarlane will be the Art Director of the newly formed 38 Studios, formerly Green Monster Games, founded by major league baseball pitcher Curt Schilling. McFarlane used to be co-owner of National Hockey League&#39;s Edmonton Oilers but sold his shares to Daryl Katz. He&#39;s also a high-profile collector of history-making baseballs.

The Tokyo Metropolitan government administers the twenty-three special wards of Tokyo, each governed as a city, that cover the area that was the city of Tokyo as well as 39 municipalities in the western part of the prefecture and the two outlying island chains. Metropolitan Tokyo is the capital and largest metropolitan area of Japan.
The population of the special wards is over 8 million people, with the total population of the prefecture exceeding 13 million.

He married the show&amp;#8217;s star, Roseanne Barr, in 1990, after she divorced her first husband. He appeared occasionally on the show as the character &amp;#8220;Arnie Thomas&amp;#8221; (a spoof of his name). The couple&amp;#8217;s marriage attracted media and especially tabloid attention due to their sometimes outrageous behavior. In 1992, Arnold starred in his own sitcom, The Jackie Thomas Show. Airing after Roseanne on ABC, the show lasted 18 episodes.
In 1993, Arnold and Barr bought a house&lt;/p&gt;

Born in North Shields, then in Northumberland, Tony Scott&#39;s first foray into filmmaking was not from behind the camera, but rather in front of it. At the age of 16, Tony appeared in Boy and Bicycle, a short film marking the directorial debut of his then 23 year-old brother Ridley. He followed in his elder brother&#39;s footsteps, studying at Grangefield School, West Hartlepool College of Art and Sunderland Art School, the last for a fine arts degree. He subsequently graduated from the Royal College of Art, fully intending to become a painter. It was only the success of his elder brother&#39;s fledging television commercial production outfit, Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), that turned his attentions towards film.
&quot;Tony had wanted to do documentaries at first. I told him, &#39;Don&#39;t go to the BBC, come to me first.&#39; I knew that he had a fondness for cars, so I told him &#39;Come work with me and within a year you&#39;ll have a Ferrari&#39;. And he did&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

It shares maritime boundaries with other nations including Barbados to the northeast, Guyana to the southeast, and Venezuela to the south and west.
The country covers an area of 5,128&amp;#160;square kilometres (1,980&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi) and consists of two main islands, Trinidad and Tobago, and numerous smaller landforms. Trinidad is the larger and more populous of the main islands; Tobago is much smaller, comprising about 6% of the total area and 4% of the entire population which is estimated at 1.3 million (2005). The nation lies outside the hurricane belt.
Trinidad and Tobago was a Spanish colony from the times of Christopher Columbus to 1802, when it was ceded to Britain. The country obtained independence in 1962. Unlike most of the English-speaking Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago&#39;s economy is primarily industrial, with an emphasis on petroleum and petrochemicals. Trinidad and Tobago has a sound macroeconomic framework and a long tradition of institutional stability. It&lt;/p&gt;

Tsui was born and raised in the Chinese section (Cho lon) of Saigon, Vietnam by his Chinese immigrant parents, in a large family with sixteen siblings. By age 13, he and his family immigrated to Hong Kong. Tsui showed an early interest in show business and movies; when he was ten, he and some friends rented an 8 mm camera with which to film the magic show they put on at school. He also drew comic books, an interest that would influence his cinematic style.
Tsui took his secondary education in Hong Kong starting in 1966. He then studied film in Texas, first at Southern Methodist University and then at the University of Texas at Austin, graduating in 1975. He claims to have told his parents he was studying to follow in his father&#39;s footsteps as a pharmacist, and that it was here he changed his given name to Hark (&quot;overcoming&quot;) (Dannen &amp;amp; Long, 1997).
After graduation, Tsui moved to New York City where he worked on From Spikes to Spindles (1976), a noted documentary by Christine Choy on the history of&lt;/p&gt;

With an estimated population of 385,635 in 2008, it is the principal municipality of the Tulsa Metropolitan Statistical Area, a region of 916,079 residents projected to reach one million between 2010 and 2012. In 2008, the Tulsa-Bartlesville Combined Statistical Area had a population of 966,531 residents. The city serves as the county seat of Tulsa County, the most densely populated county in Oklahoma, and extends into Osage, Rogers, and Wagoner counties.
Tulsa was first settled in the 1830s by the Lachapoka Band of Creek Native American tribe. In 1921, it was the site of the infamous Tulsa Race Riot, one of the largest and most destructive acts of racial violence in the history of the United States. For most of the 20th century, the city held the nickname &quot;Oil Capital of the World&quot; and played a major role as one of the most important hubs for the American oil industry. Tulsa, along with several other cities, claims to be the birthplace of U.S. Route 66. Tulsa is also known for its Western Swing music.

The Turks and Caicos Islands lie southeast of Mayaguana in the Bahamas and north of the island of Hispaniola. Cockburn Town, the capital, is situated about 1,042&amp;#160;kilometres (647&amp;#160;mi) east-southeast of Miami in the United States. The islands have a total land area of 430&amp;#160;square kilometres (170&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi). The islands are geographically contiguous to the Bahamas, but are politically a separate entity.
The total population is about 36,000, of whom approximately 22,500 live on Providenciales in the Caicos Islands. Cockburn Town, the capital, is on Grand Turk Island.
In August 2009, the United Kingdom suspended the Turks and Caicos&#39; self-government after allegations of ministerial corruption.

Its nearest neighbours are Kiribati, Nauru, Samoa and Fiji. It comprises four reef islands and five true atolls. Its population of 12,373 makes it the second-least-populated sovereign state in the world, with only Vatican City having fewer inhabitants. In terms of physical land size, at just 26&amp;#160;square kilometres (10&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi) Tuvalu is the fourth smallest country in the world, larger only than the Vatican City at 0.44&amp;#160;km (0.17&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi), Monaco at 1.95&amp;#160;km (0.75&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi) and Nauru at 21&amp;#160;km (8.1&amp;#160;sq&amp;#160;mi).
The first inhabitants of Tuvalu were Polynesian people. The islands came under the UK&#39;s sphere of influence in the late 19th century. The Ellice Islands were administered by Britain as part of a protectorate from 1892 to 1916 and as part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony from 1916 to 1974. In 1974, the Ellice Islanders voted for separate British dependency status as Tuvalu, separating from the Gilbert Islands which became Kiribati upon independence.

(March 24, 1901 &amp;#8211; July 7, 1971) was a two-time Academy Award winning American animator, cartoonist and special effects technician, who was famous for his work for Walt Disney. He was born Ubbe Ert Iwwerks in Kansas City, Missouri.
His name is explained by his Frisian roots; his father, Eert Ubbe Iwwerks, emigrated to the USA in 1869 from the village Uttum in East Frisia (northwest Germany, today part of the municipality of Krummh&amp;#246;rn). Ub&#39;s birth name can be seen on early &amp;#8220;Alice&amp;#8221; shorts that he signed. Several years later he simplified his name to &amp;#8220;Ub Iwerks&amp;#8221; (pronounced /&amp;#712;&amp;#652;b &amp;#712;a&amp;#618;w&amp;#604;rks/).
Iwerks was considered by many to be Walt Disney&#39;s oldest friend, and spent most of his career with Disney. The two met in 1919 while working for the Pesman Art Studio in Kansas City, and would eventually start their own commercial art business together. Disney and Iwerks then found work as illustrators for the Kansas City Slide Newspaper Company (which would later be named The Kansas City Film Ad Company). While working for the Kansas City Film Ad Company, Disney decided to take up work in animation, and Iwerks soon joined him.

The southern part of the country includes a substantial portion of Lake Victoria, which is also bordered by Kenya and Tanzania.
Uganda takes its name from the Buganda kingdom, which encompassed a portion of the south of the country including the capital Kampala. Fifty-one percent of the population of the country lives slightly below the international poverty line of US $1.25 a day.
The people of Uganda were hunter-gatherers until 1,700 to 2,300 years ago. Bantu-speaking populations, who were probably from central and western Africa, migrated to the southern parts of the country. These groups brought and developed ironworking skills and new ideas of social and political organization. The Empire of Kitara in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries represents the earliest forms of formal organization, followed by the kingdom of Bunyoro-Kitara, and in later centuries, Buganda and&lt;/p&gt;

Ulverston&#39;s most visible landmark is Hoad Monument, a concrete structure built in 1850 to commemorate statesman and local resident Sir John Barrow. The monument provides scenic views of the surrounding areas, including Morecambe Bay and parts of the Lake District.
Ulverston Canal, which is no longer navigable, is claimed to be the deepest, widest and shortest canal in the United Kingdom at 1&amp;#188; miles. The canal was once a vital component of the town&#39;s economy.
The town is home to many shops and pubs, some of which are located on the stone sett (paving) main street, Market Street. At the head of the street is the war memorial to local soldiers who died in World War I.
Ulverston is a comparatively large civil parish. It is bounded in the east by the Leven estuary, Crake, Coniston Water, and Yewdale Beck. To the west the boundary follows a chain of hills, and beyond that lie the towns of Kirkby-in-Furness and Askam and Ireleth. To the south is&lt;/p&gt;

Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, the English Channel and the Irish Sea. The largest island, Great Britain, is linked to France by the Channel Tunnel.
The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy and unitary state consisting of four countries: England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. It is governed by a parliamentary system with its seat of government in London, the capital, but with three devolved national administrations of varying powers in Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh, the capitals of Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland respectively. The Channel Island bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey, and the Isle of Man are Crown Dependencies, which means they are constitutionally tied to&lt;/p&gt;

The islands are geographically part of the Virgin Islands archipelago and are located in the Leeward Islands of the Lesser Antilles.
The U.S. Virgin Islands consist of the main islands of Saint Croix, Saint John and Saint Thomas, along with the much smaller but historically distinct Water Island, and many other surrounding minor islands. The main islands have nicknames often used by locals: &quot;Twin City&quot; (St. Croix), &quot;Rock City&quot; (St. Thomas), &quot;Love City&quot; (St. John), and &quot;Small City&quot; (Water Island).
The total land area of the territory is 133.73&amp;#160;square miles (346.4&amp;#160;km). As of the 2000 census the population was 108,612.
The Virgin Islands were originally settled by the Ciboney, Carib, and Arawaks. The islands were named by Christopher Columbus on his second voyage in 1493 for Saint Ursula and her virgin followers. Over the next three hundred years, the islands were held by many European powers, including Spain, The United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, and Denmark-Norway.

Located 16.5&amp;#160;miles (26.6&amp;#160;km) east-northeast of Charing Cross, it is one of the locally important district centres identified in the London Plan, and comprises a number of shopping streets and a large residential area. It was historically a rural village in the county of Essex and formed an ancient parish. Although peripheral to London, the town has good transport links; it was first connected to central London by rail in 1885 and has a station on the London Underground network. The economic history of Upminster is characterised by a shift from farming to garden suburb. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Upminster significantly expanded and increased in population, becoming part of Hornchurch Urban District in 1934, and has formed part of Greater London since 1965.
The placename Upminster is first recorded in 1062 as Upmynstre and is recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book as Upmunstra. It is formed from Old English upp and mynster, meaning the large church on high ground. The high ground of the parish church being in relation to the valley of the River&lt;/p&gt;

The town, located along the Rhine, has about 5,100 inhabitants (as of 2009), most of whom are Roman Catholic. Its cathedral is the seat of a Roman Catholic archbishop.
While Vaduz is better known internationally, it is actually not the largest town in the principality: neighbouring Schaan has a greater population.
Vaduz is said to be mentioned in historic 12th century manuscripts as Farduzes. It is however commonly believed to have been founded in the thirteenth century by the Counts of Werdenberg. In 1322 a mention of the castle is made, which was sacked by the Swiss in 1499.
In the 17th century the Liechtenstein family was seeking a seat in the Imperial diet, the Reichstag. However, since they did not hold any territory that was directly under the Imperial throne, they were unable to meet the primary requirement to qualify.
The family yearned for the added power a seat in the Imperial government would bring, and therefore sought to acquire lands that would be Reichsunmittelbar, or held without any feudal personage other than the Holy&lt;/p&gt;

Valletta contains buildings from the 16th century onwards, built during the rule of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem (the Knights Hospitaller). The city is essentially Baroque in character, with elements of Mannerist, Neo-Classical and Modern architecture in selected areas, though World War II left major scars on the city. The City of Valletta was officially recognised as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1980.
The city is named for Jean Parisot de la Valette, who succeeded in defending the island from an Ottoman invasion in 1565. The official name given by the Order of Saint John was Humilissima Civitas Valletta &amp;#8212; The Most Humble City of Valletta, or Citt&amp;#224; Umilissima in Italian.

It is named for British Captain George Vancouver, who explored the area in the 1790s. The name Vancouver itself originates from the Dutch &quot;van Coevorden&quot;, denoting somebody from Coevorden, a city in the Netherlands.
The largest metropolitan area in Western Canada, Vancouver ranks third largest in the country and the city proper ranks eighth. According to the 2006 census Vancouver had a population of 578,041 and its Census Metropolitan Area exceeded 2.1 million people. Its residents are ethnically and linguistically diverse; 52% do not speak English as their first language.
Logging sawmills established in 1867 in the area known as Gastown became the nucleus around which the townsite grew, and Vancouver was incorporated as a city in 1886. By 1887, the transcontinental railway was extended to the city to take advantage of its large natural seaport, which soon became a vital link in a trade route between the Orient, Eastern Canada, and London. The Port Metro Vancouver is now the busiest and largest in Canada, as well as the fourth largest port (by tonnage) in North America.&lt;/p&gt;

The archipelago, which is of volcanic origin, is some 1,750&amp;#160;kilometres (1,090&amp;#160;mi) east of northern Australia, 500&amp;#160;kilometres (310&amp;#160;mi) northeast of New Caledonia, west of Fiji, and southeast of the Solomon Islands, near New Guinea.
Vanuatu was first inhabited by Melanesian people. Europeans began to settle in the area in the late 18th century. In the 1880s France and the United Kingdom claimed parts of the country, and in 1906 they agreed on a framework for jointly managing the archipelago as the New Hebrides through a British-French Condominium. An independence movement arose in the 1970s, and the Republic of Vanuatu was created in 1980.
The prehistory of Vanuatu is obscure; archaeological evidence supports the commonly held theory that peoples speaking Austronesian languages first came to the islands some 4,000 years ago. Pottery fragments have been found dating back to 1300&amp;#8211;1100 B.C.E.

It has an area of approximately 44 hectares (110&amp;#160;acres), and a population of just over 800.
Vatican City was established in 1929. It is distinct from the Holy See, which dates back to early Christianity and is the main episcopal see of 1.147 billion Latin and Eastern Catholic adherents around the globe. Ordinances of Vatican City are published in Italian; official documents of the Holy See are issued mainly in Latin. The two entities even have distinct passports: the Holy See, not being a country, only issues diplomatic and service passports; the state of Vatican City issues normal passports. Very few passports are issued by either authority.
The Lateran Treaty in 1929, which brought the city-state into existence, spoke of it as a new creation (Preamble and Article III), not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States (756-1870) that had previously encompassed central&lt;/p&gt;

As of the United States 2000 Census, the township population was 13,533, making it the 181st most populous municipality in New Jersey (out of 566 statewide).
In 2008, New Jersey Monthly magazine ranked Verona #1 in Essex County and #3 in New Jersey as &quot;Top Places to Live in New Jersey&quot;.
Verona and several neighboring towns were all originally one town known as the Horseneck Tract. In 1702, a group of settlers left Newark and purchased a large tract of land northwest of their home city for the equivalent of a few hundred dollars from the Lenni Lenape Native Americans. This piece of land extended west and north to the Passaic River, south to the town center of what would become Livingston, and east to the First Watchung Mountain, and was called Horseneck by the natives because it resembled the neck and head of a horse.
What was then known as Horseneck contained most of the present day northern Essex County towns: Verona, along with Caldwell, West Caldwell, Cedar Grove, Essex Fells, Fairfield, North Caldwell, and Roseland are all located entirely in Horseneck, and parts of what are today Livingston, Montclair, and West&lt;/p&gt;

Vienna is Austria&#39;s primary city, with a population of about 1.7 million (2.3 million within the metropolitan area, more than 25% of Austria&#39;s population), and is by far the largest city in Austria, as well as its cultural, economic, and political centre. It is the 10th largest city by population in the European Union. Vienna is host to many major international organizations such as the United Nations and OPEC.
Vienna lies in the east of Austria and is close to Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary. In 2001, the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site and in 2005 an Economist Intelligence Unit study of 127 world cities ranked it first equal with Vancouver for the quality of life. This assessment was mirrored by the Mercer Survey in 2009.
The English name of Vienna, the official German name Wien, and the names of the city in most languages, are thought to be derived from the Celtic name of a settlement, but opinions vary on the precise origin. Some claim that the name comes from Vedunia, meaning &quot;forest&lt;/p&gt;

Wales has a population estimated at three million and is officially bilingual; Welsh and English have equal status, and bilingual signs are the norm throughout the land. For most people in Wales, English is their only language. The once-steady decline in Welsh speaking has reversed over recent years, however, with Welsh speakers currently estimated to be around 20% of the population.
During the Iron Age and early medieval period, Wales was inhabited by the Celtic Britons. A distinct Welsh national identity emerged in the centuries after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations today. In the 13th century, the defeat of Llewelyn by Edward I completed the Anglo-Norman conquest of Wales and brought about centuries of English occupation. Wales was subsequently incorporated into England with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535&amp;#8211;1542, creating the legal entity known today as England and Wales. Distinctive Welsh politics&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Wallasey is a town within the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, in Merseyside, England, on the mouth of the River Mersey, at the northeastern corner of the Wirral Peninsula. According to the 2001 Census, the town had a total resident population of 58,710.
The name of Wallasey originates from the Germanic word Walha, meaning stranger or foreigner, which is also the origin of the name Wales. The suffix &amp;#8220;-ey&amp;#8221; denotes an island or area of dry land. Originally the higher ground now occupied by Wallasey was separated from the rest of Wirral by the creek known as Wallasey Pool (which later became the docks), the marshy areas of Bidston Moss and Leasowe, and sand dunes along the coast.
Before the 19th century the area was sparsely populated. Horse races organised for the Earls of Derby on the sands at Leasowe in the 16th and 17th centuries are regarded as forerunners of the modern Derby.
Old maps show that the main centre and parish church (St Hilary&amp;#8217;s) were located at what is now called Wallasey Village, and there were smaller hamlets at Liscard, Poulton and Seacombe, from where there were occasional ferries across the Mersey. There was also a mill (at Mill Lane), and from the mid-18th&lt;/p&gt;

The City of Washington was originally a separate municipality within the Territory of Columbia until an act of Congress in 1871 effectively merged the City and the Territory into a single entity called the District of Columbia. It is for this reason that the city, while legally named the District of Columbia, is known as Washington, D.C. The city shares its name with the U.S. state of Washington, which is located on the country&#39;s Pacific coast.
The city is located on the north bank of the Potomac River and is bordered by the states of Virginia to the southwest and Maryland to the other sides. The District has a resident population of 599,657; because of commuters from the surrounding suburbs, its population rises to over one&amp;#160;million during the workweek.

West Bromwich was first mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, the name meaning &quot;the little village on the heath of broom&quot; (broom being a particular type of bush). It is believed that it may have originally been part of the Handsworth parish. A Benedictine priory existed in West Bromwich from the 12th century around which the settlement of Broomwich Heath grew. In 1727, the town became a stop on the coaching road between London and Shrewsbury and its growth began.

From the 1990 reunification onwards, the still existing, but now enlarged Federal Republic of Germany with sixteen states has been exclusively known as Germany in common usage.
The Federal Republic of Germany was organized from the initially 11 states formed in the three Western Zones or Allied Zones of occupation held by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. The city of Bonn was its provisional capital city. The fourth Allied occupation zone or East Zone (Ostzone) was held by the Soviet Union. The parts east of the Oder-Neisse were de facto annexed by the Soviet Union and Communist Poland, the remaining central part around Berlin became the communist German Democratic Republic, GDR (in German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik, DDR) with its de facto capital&lt;/p&gt;

Founded in 1630 (contemporaneously with Boston), West Roxbury, Massachusetts was originally part of the town of Roxbury and was mainly used as farmland. West Roxbury seceded from Roxbury in 1851, and was annexed by Boston in 1874. At the time, the town included the neighborhoods of Jamaica Plain and Roslindale.
West Roxbury&#39;s main thoroughfare is Centre Street, lined with local restaurants and commercial establishments. Today, the neighborhood&#39;s tree-lined streets and mostly single family homes give it a suburban feel in an urban setting. Life in the neighborhood centers on political and civic activism as well as local parishes and youth athletic leagues. West Roxbury is home to many of Boston&#39;s civil servants. The community boasts a significant proportion of persons of Irish descent as well as a smaller number of more recent Irish immigrants. The Roxbury Latin School, founded in 1645 is located on Saint Theresa Avenue in West Roxbury since 1927. The school&#39;s endowment is estimated at $143.8 million, the&lt;/p&gt;

As of the 2000 census its population was 344,284. The 2008 estimated population of 366,046 made it the 51st largest city in the country and the most populous city in Kansas. Wichita is located in south central Kansas on the Arkansas River.
The city was incorporated in 1870, based on the success of businessmen who came to hunt and trade with native populations. Its position on the Chisholm Trail made it a destination for cattle drives headed north to access railroads to eastern markets. In the 20th century, aircraft pioneers such as Clyde Cessna, Walter Beech and Bill Lear began projects that would lead to Wichita&#39;s establishment as the &quot;Air Capital of the World&quot;. The aircraft corporations Stearman Aircraft, Cessna, Mooney and Beechcraft were all founded in Wichita in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Cessna and Hawker Beechcraft remain based in Wichita today, along with Learjet and Spirit AeroSystems, and both Airbus and Boeing maintain a workforce in Wichita.
Wichita has evolved into a cultural and entertainment center. The downtown district offers nightclubs,&lt;/p&gt;

William Schloss was born in New York City to a Jewish family. Schloss means &quot;castle&quot; in German, and Castle probably chose to translate his surname into English to avoid the discrimination often encountered by Jewish entertainers of his time. He spent most of his teenage years working on Broadway in a number of jobs ranging from set building to acting. This put him in a good stead to become a director, and he left for Hollywood at the age of 23, going on to direct his first film 6 years later. He also worked an as assistant to director Orson Welles, doing much of the second unit location work for Welles&#39; noir classic, The Lady from Shanghai.
Castle was famous for directing films with many gimmicks which were ambitiously promoted, despite being reasonably low budget B-movies. Five of these were scripted by adventure novelist Robb White. Recently, two of his films have been remade, House on Haunted Hill in 1999, and Thirteen Ghosts in 2001 (the latter retitled Thir13en Ghosts).
He also produced, and had a brief non-speaking role in, Roman Polanski&#39;s film Rosemary&#39;s Baby (1968). Castle is&lt;/p&gt;

Holden won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1954, and the Emmy Award for Best Actor in 1974. One of the top stars of the 1950s, he was named one of the &quot;Top 10 stars of the year&quot; six times (1954&amp;#8211;1958, 1961) and appeared on the American Film Institute&#39;s AFI&#39;s 100 Years... 100 Stars list as #25.
Holden, eldest of three sons (brothers were Robert and Richard), was born as William Franklin Beedle, Jr. in O&#39;Fallon, Illinois, the son of Mary Blanche (n&amp;#233;e Ball), a schoolteacher, and William Franklin Beedle, Sr., an industrial chemist. The family, which moved to South Pasadena, California when he was three, was of English descent; Holden&#39;s paternal great-grandmother, Rebecca Westfield, was born in England in 1817, while some of his mother&#39;s ancestors emigrated in the 17th century to Millenback, Lancaster County, Virginia in the U.S. from England.
After graduating from South Pasadena High School, Holden attended Pasadena Junior College, where he became involved in local radio plays. Contrary to legend and theatre publicity, he did not study at the Pasadena Playhouse, nor was he discovered in a play there.&lt;/p&gt;

Frakes went to seven auditions over six weeks before being cast as Riker. Frakes stated: &quot;I started with the cattle call, then the casting director, the producer, then other directors, to Gene Roddenberry, and then through the Paramount execs, including the vice-president himself and the heads of television.&quot;
For the first two seasons, Riker is portrayed as bold and confident, an ambitious young officer; however, over time Riker&#39;s character becomes more reserved, as experience teaches him the wisdom of a patient, careful approach. He becomes comfortable on the Enterprise, repeatedly turning down offers of his own command, and he learns to cherish the company of his fellow officers. Nonetheless, Riker retains a willingness to occasionally disregard the chain of command. Riker is usually referred to as &quot;Will&quot;, although in early first season episodes of TNG he is sometimes called &quot;Bill&quot; by Deanna Troi. He is also usually (and informally) called &quot;Number One&quot; by Captain Picard, due to his position as First Officer&lt;/p&gt;

The area now known as Wilmington was first colonized by settlers from Sweden who in March, 1638, established Fort Christina at the mouth of the Christina River at the area known as &quot;The Rocks&quot;, located near the foot of present-day Seventh Street. Fort Christina served as the headquarters for the colony of New Sweden which consisted of, for the most part, the lower Delaware River region (parts of present day Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey), but settled few colonists there. Dr. Timothy Stidham (Swedish:Timen Lulofsson Stiddem) was a prominent citizen and doctor in Wilmington. He was born in 1610, probably in Hammel,&lt;/p&gt;

It is located in central Namibia in the Khomas Highland plateau area around 1,700&amp;#160;metres (5,600&amp;#160;ft) above sea level. The 2001 census determined Windhoek&#39;s population was 233,529. A population influx from all over Namibia has caused researchers to estimate the figure to be well over 300,000.
Due to its relative size Windhoek is even more so than other capitals the social, economic, and cultural centre of the country. Virtually every national enterprise has its headquarters here. The University of Namibia is here, as is the country&#39;s only theatre, most of Namibia&#39;s governmental institutions, and all major media bodies. City of Windhoek&#39;s budget nearly equals that of all other Namibian local authorities combined.
The city of Windhoek is traditionally known by two names: /Ai//Gams, (Khoekhoe: hot springs) and Otjomuise (Otjiherero: place of steam). Both traditional names reference the hot springs near today&#39;s city centre.
Theories vary on how the place got its modern name of Windhoek. Most believe the name Windhoek is derived from the Afrikaans word Wind-Hoek&lt;/p&gt;

It is within Essex County, Ontario, although administratively separated from the county government. Windsor is across the Detroit River and south of Detroit, Michigan in the United States. Windsor is known as The City of Roses and residents are known as Windsorites.
Prior to European exploration and settlement, the Windsor area was inhabited by the First Nations and Native American people. Windsor was settled by the French in 1749 as an agricultural settlement. It was the oldest continually inhabited European settlement in Canada west of Montreal. The area was first named Petite C&amp;#244;te (&quot;Little Coast&quot; - as opposed to the longer coastline on the Detroit side of the river). Later it was called La C&amp;#244;te de Mis&amp;#232;re (&quot;Poverty Coast&quot;) because of the sandy soils near LaSalle.
Windsor&#39;s French heritage is reflected in many French street names, such as Ouellette, Pelissier, Fran&amp;#231;ois, Pierre, Langlois, Marentette, and Lauzon. The current street system of Windsor (a grid with elongated blocks) reflects the French method of agricultural land&lt;/p&gt;

It is located near the longitudinal centre of North America, in south central Canada, near the eastern edge of the Canadian Prairies, at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers (a point now commonly known as The Forks). It lies near to the Canadian Shield and hundreds of lakes including Lake Winnipeg and Lake Manitoba.
The name &quot;Winnipeg&quot; comes from the Cree words meaning muddy water, referring to the dark water of the rivers and lakes in the region. The Winnipeg area was a trading centre for Aboriginal peoples prior to the arrival of Europeans. The first fort was built near the Forks of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers in 1738 by French traders. A settlement was later founded by the Selkirk settlers in 1812, the nucleus of which was incorporated as the City of Winnipeg in 1873.

Allen&#39;s distinctive films, which run the gamut from dramas to screwball sex comedies, have made him a notable American director. He is also distinguished by his rapid rate of production and his very large body of work. Allen writes and directs his movies and has also acted in the majority of them. For inspiration, Allen draws heavily on literature, sexuality, philosophy, psychology, Jewish identity, and the history of cinema, among a wealth of other fields of interest.
Allen developed a passion for music early on and is a celebrated jazz clarinetist. What began as a teenage avocation has led to regular public performances at various small venues in his hometown of Manhattan, with occasional appearances at various jazz festivals. Allen joined the Preservation Hall Jazz Band and the New Orleans Funeral Ragtime Orchestra in performances that provided the film score for his 1973 comedy Sleeper, and performed in a rare European tour in 1996, which became the subject of the documentary Wild Man Blues.

Worf was at first not intended to be a regular character, since Roddenberry wanted to avoid &quot;retreads of characters or races featured prominently in the original Star Trek series&quot;, and so the June 1, 1987 cast portrait did not include Worf. Several &quot;tall, slim, black actors&quot; auditioned for Worf before Michael Dorn came along, walking into the audition in character and not smiling  (Indeed, Michael Dorn found the seriousness of the role, especially during the audition, at first to be uncomfortable, since he considers himself a comedian at heart).

The borough covers an area of 12.5&amp;#160;square miles (32.37&amp;#160;km) and has a population of 100,200.
The area around Worthing has been populated for at least 6,000 years and contains Britain&#39;s greatest concentration of Stone Age flint mines, which are some of the earliest mines in Europe. Lying within the borough, the Iron Age hill fort of Cissbury Ring is one of Britain&#39;s largest. Worthing means &quot;(place of) Worth/Wor&amp;#333;&#39;s people&quot;, from the Old English personal name Worth/Wor&amp;#333; (the name means &quot;valiant one, one who is noble&quot;), and -ingas &quot;people of&quot; (reduced to -ing in the modern name). For many centuries Worthing was a small mackerel fishing hamlet until in the late 18th century it developed into an elegant Georgian seaside resort and attracted the well-known and wealthy of the day. In the 19th and 20th centuries the area was one of Britain&#39;s chief market gardening centres.

Sitting on the southeast bank of the Yangtze River, Wuhu borders Xuancheng to the southeast, Chizhou and Tongling to the southwest, Chaohu to the northwest, Ma&#39;anshan to the northeast, and the province of Jiangsu to the east.
The prefecture-level city of Wuhu administers 7 county-level divisions, including 4 districts and 3 counties.
Wuhu is known to have been inhabited since at least 770 BCE. It became a strategically important town during the Three Kingdoms period (220 BC-65 AD), when it was controlled by the Eastern Wu. At this time it was known as Qiuzu (Chiu-tzu). Under the Ming dynasty Wuhu developed into a major commercial center and river port, and since that time has been known as a center of the rice trade.
In 1644, the Hongguang Emperor (better known as the Prince of Fu), one of the last emperors of the Ming Dynasty, was captured by forces of the new Qing Dynasty in Wuhu. The city became a treaty port in 1876 and has remained a commercial center since that time. The city&#39;s Roman Catholic cathedral, St. Joseph&lt;/p&gt;

Located at the Main River, it is the capital of the Regierungsbezirk Lower Franconia. The regional dialect is Franconian.
W&amp;#252;rzburg is approximately 120&amp;#160;kilometres (75&amp;#160;mi) from either Frankfurt or Nuremberg by road. The city of W&amp;#252;rzburg is not included in the district of W&amp;#252;rzburg, but is its administrative seat (Landkreis). Its population is 131,320 as of December 31, 2006.
By 1000 BC a Celtic fortification stood on the site of the present Fortress Marienberg. It was Christianized in 686 by Irish missionaries Kilian, Kolonat and Totnan. The city is first mentioned as Vurteburch in 704. The first diocese was founded by Saint Boniface in 742. He appointed the first bishop of W&amp;#252;rzburg, Saint Burkhard. The bishops eventually created a duchy with its center in the city, which extended in the 12th century to Eastern Franconia. The city was the seat of several Imperial diets, including the one of 1180, in which Henry the Lion was banned from the Empire and his duchy was handed over to Otto of Wittelsbach.

Berkeley was born in Brooklyn, New York, though he has lived most of his life in New Jersey. Berkeley went to Hampshire College and worked in the theaters at the five college system which Hampshire was a part of, including Smith, Mt. Holyoke, Amherst, and the University of Massachusetts. Berkeley worked in the Regional and Repertory Theaters in addition to Off Broadway while living in New York. Despite a classically trained theater background, he was increasingly drawn to the subtleties of film acting. A play written by Reynolds Price called &quot;Early Dark&quot; had such a cinematic feel to it, that an agent saw the acting potential in Berkeley and encouraged him to make the move out west.
Berkeley began playing minor roles in 1981, with early appearances in M*A*S*H, Cagney &amp;amp; Lacey, Remington Steele, Miami Vice, Moonlighting and The A-Team. Although not becoming a household name, Berkeley&#39;s face was increasingly recognizable into the 1990s. His later television guest roles included The X-Files, CSI, ER, 24 and Law &amp;amp; Order.

She was born in Osaka, Japan to a Japanese mother, and a British father. In early 1984, the Japanese movie studio Toho Company Ltd. held their first Toho Cinderella beauty contest, and Yasuko, almost 19 at the time, was chosen as the first Toho Cinderella, beating out the other 30,000 contestants.
Shortly after, she made her film debut in the film Karate Cop III: Song of the Sea, before co-starring as the heroine Naoko Okumura in The Return of Godzilla, which was the grand comeback film for the famous movie monster Godzilla. She appeared in the next Godzilla film 5 years later, 1989&#39;s Godzilla vs. Biollante, but as another character (Erika Shiragami, who played a part in the creation of Godzilla&#39;s titular adversary). At the Toho Cinderella beauty contest that same year, she took place with the 2nd Toho Cinderella, 1987 winner Megumi Odaka (who was also in Biollante, starting her Miki Saegusa character).
She has since appeared in numerous movies and television (her TV show debut was Mio&#39;s Devotion in 1985), and is considered one of Japan&#39;s most beautiful and talented&lt;/p&gt;

The city has a rich heritage and has provided the backdrop to major political events throughout much of its two millennia of existence.
The city was founded by the Romans in 71&amp;#160;AD. They called it Eboracum, a name perhaps derived from one used by the British tribes who inhabited the area. The Romans made it the capital of their Province of Britannia Inferior. At the end of Roman rule in 415&amp;#160;AD the settlement was taken over by the Angles and the city was renamed Eoforwic. It served as the capital of the Anglian Kingdom of Northumbria. When the Vikings captured the city in 866&amp;#160;AD they renamed it J&amp;#243;rv&amp;#237;k and it became the capital of a wider kingdom of the same name covering much of Northern England. After the Norman conquest, the name &quot;York&quot;, which was first used in the 13th&amp;#160;century, gradually evolved. In the Middle Ages York grew as a major wool trading centre and the ecclesiastical capital of the northern province of England. The Province of York has remained one of the two Church of England ecclesiastical provinces, along with that of&lt;/p&gt;

York is currently the 14th largest city in Pennsylvania.
York was founded in 1741 by settlers from the Philadelphia region, and named for the English city of the same name. By 1777, most of the area residents were of either German or Scotch-Irish descent. York was incorporated as a borough on September 24, 1787, and as a city on January 11, 1887. During the American Revolutionary War (1775&amp;#8211;1783), York served as the temporary capital of the Continental Congress. The Articles of Confederation were drafted and adopted in York, though they would not be ratified until March of 1781.
York was the first Capital of the United States, although historians generally consider it to be the fourth capital, after Philadelphia, Baltimore and Lancaster. The claim arises from the assertion that the Articles of Confederation was the first legal document to refer to the colonies as &quot;the United States of&lt;/p&gt;

Zambia has been inhabited for thousands of years by hunter-gatherers and migrating tribes. After sporadic visits by European explorers starting in the 18th century, Zambia was gradually claimed and occupied by the British as protectorate of Northern Rhodesia towards the end of the nineteenth century.
On 24 October 1964, the protectorate gained independence with the new name of Zambia, derived from the Zambezi river which flows through the country. Zambia was governed by president Kenneth Kaunda of the socialist United National Independence Party from 1964 until 1991. From 1991 to 2002, Zambia was governed by&lt;/p&gt;

James Cromwell later played Cochrane in the 1996 feature film Star Trek: First Contact and the 2001 Star Trek: Enterprise pilot, &quot;Broken Bow&quot;. Footage of Cromwell from Star Trek: First Contact was used in the Enterprise episode &quot;In a Mirror (Part I)&quot;, along with new footage of an identically-dressed actor whose face is not shown.
As established by the events of Star Trek: First Contact, Cochrane is the first human to invent warp drive, in 2063, drawing the attention of the Vulcans, and leading to humanity&#39;s first contact with an alien race.
Cochrane was born in 2030 (or 2013, according to the First Contact novelization). He constructed humanity&#39;s first warp-capable vessel, the Phoenix, in Bozeman, Montana, out of an old Titan II nuclear missile. According to his dialog in Star Trek: First Contact, he started the project for financial gain.
On April 5, 2063, Cochrane made Earth&#39;s first warp flight, playing Steppenwolf&#39;s &quot;Magic Carpet Ride&quot; during blast-off. The&lt;/p&gt;

Zoe married Serenity&#39;s pilot Wash sometime after he joined the crew, though initially she claimed that something about him &quot;bothered&quot; her&amp;#65506;&amp;#65408;&amp;#65428;possibly his disturbing moustache (seen in flashback in the episode &quot;Out of Gas&quot;).

Debuting in the Modern Age of Comic Books, the character of Eddie Brock has featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as animated television series; video games; a feature film and merchandise such as action figures and trading cards.
Writer David Michelinie and artist Todd McFarlane are generally credited with the character&#39;s creation, based on a number of plot ideas and concepts from various other creators, though the degree to which McFarlane should be credited with co-creating the character has been a source of dispute in the comic book industry. The question of who created the character of Venom became an issue of contention in 1993 when Michelinie wrote to the comic book industry magazine Wizard, which had referred to Michelinie in issue #17 as &quot;co-creator&quot; of Venom. In his letter, printed in issue #21 (May 1993), Michelinie wrote that he was the character&#39;s sole creator, while saying also he believed that without McFarlane the character would not&lt;/p&gt;

Kom&amp;#225;rno was formed from part of a historical town in Hungary situated on both banks of the Danube. Following World War I, the border of the newly created Czechoslovakia cut the historical, unified town in half, creating two new towns. The smaller part, based on the former suburb of &amp;#218;jsz&amp;#337;ny, is in present-day Hungary as Kom&amp;#225;rom (the historical Hungarian town had the same name). Kom&amp;#225;rno and Kom&amp;#225;rom are connected by the Elizabeth bridge, and the two towns used to be a border crossing between Slovakia and Hungary until border checks were lifted due to the Schengen Area rules.
Kom&amp;#225;rno is Slovakia&#39;s principal port on the Danube. It is also the center of the Hungarian community in Slovakia, which makes up roughly 60% of the town&#39;s population. The town is the historic seat of the Serbian national minority in Slovakia.
One disputed record of the name of the settlement can be dated back to 1075 as Camarum. Further documents mention the settlement as Kamarn(iensis) / Komarn(iense) (1218), Kamarum&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Alton is a small market town in Hampshire, England, to the southwest of Farnham. It had a population of 16,584 at the 1991 census, and is administered by East Hampshire district council. It also is home to Treloar College, the National Specialist college for Young Disabled People. The town is twinned with Pertuis, France  and Montecchio Maggiore, Italy.
Jane Austen lived in the nearby village of Chawton.
A Roman road ran from Chichester to Silchester and there is evidence of a Roman posting station at Neatham near Alton, probably called Vindomis, and a ford across the River Wey. Centuries later, a Saxon settlement was established in the area and a large seventh century cemetery has been discovered during building excavations. It contained a selection of grave goods which included the Alton Buckle which is on display in the Curtis Museum, and is considered to be the finest piece of Anglo Saxon craftsmanship found in Hampshire. The buckle was found in the grave of a warrior, and has a silver-gilt body, set with garnets and glass.
The River Wey has its source in the town, and the name Alton comes from an Anglo-Saxon word &quot;aewielltun&quot; meaning &quot;farmstead at the source of the river&quot;.

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Sandman (William Baker, a.k.a. Flint Marko) is a fictional character who appears in comic books published by Marvel Comics. A shapeshifter endowed through an accident with the ability to turn himself into sand, he eventually reformed, and became an ally of Spider-Man. The character has been adapted into various other media incarnations of Spider-Man, including animated cartoons and the 2007 film Spider-Man 3, in which he is played by Academy Award nominated actor Thomas Haden Church.
In 2009, Sandman was ranked as IGN&#39;s 72nd Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.
The Sandman first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #4 (Sept. 1963), created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko as an adversary Spider-Man. The Sandman was later an ally of Spider-Man, as well as a member of the Avengers and Silver Sable&#39;s &quot;Wild Pack&quot; team of mercenaries.
William Baker was born in Queens, New York. At three years old his father abandoned him and his mother, a cleaning lady. In these early years she took her son to Coney Island beach. He lost himself happily in sand sculptures, a craft he would use in secondary school under the encouragement of his teacher (and first crush), Miss Flint.

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Queen Lillian is a character from the Shrek films, produced by Dreamworks. She was the wife of King Harold (currently a widow), and mother to Princess Fiona.
Queen Lillian makes her debut in the film Shrek 2, as Queen of Far Far Away. Although initially surprised at Fiona&#39;s transformation into an ogre, she is far more understanding of what has happened and, seeing that her daughter is deeply in love, accepts Shrek into their family. When King Harold is turned back into the Frog King at the end of the movie, she still accepts him as she did years ago.
In Shrek the Third, she becomes a more determined character, leading the pack of princesses through a series of tunnels in the castle, and breaking two walls with her head, whilst humming &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; (an in-joke referring to the song sung by Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music). She is able to rally the other princesses from being damsels in distress to independent fighters. It was also revealed in the movie that Fiona inherited her fighting skills from her mother (Lillian even asks &quot;Well where do you think you got all your skills from, your father?&quot;). Lillian is last seen after the movie&#39;s finale in Shrek&#39;s swamp home,&lt;/p&gt;

The character also appeared briefly in the original story Shrek!. He currently has 6 children, with his wife, Dragon.
Donkey is seen as being very annoying and obnoxious.
He likes to sing and also has a sweet tooth. He enjoys such foods as waffles, parfait and &quot;upside-down coconut souffl&amp;#233; with mango chutney sauce.&quot; In a scene about Merlin&#39;s bonfire, Donkey&#39;s sweet tooth gets the best of him, for he sees only a fudge torte on it in the enchanted smoke.
In the &quot;Meet the Cast of Shrek 2&quot; segment that is featured in the Special Features part on the Shrek 2 DVD, Eddie Murphy says: &quot;Donkey is a really positive character. He&#39;s always looking at the bright side of everything, trying to work it out. A happy-go-lucky donkey.&quot;
The first appearance of Donkey is when an old woman tries to sell him to Lord Farquaad&#39;s guards for money. Since Donkey refuses to talk, the captain doesn&#39;t believe that he can. By his own oral accounts, Donkey had suffered a life of abuse and ridicule before (literally) running into Shrek, a grouchy, reclusive ogre. When&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Satan is an occasional character in the animated series South Park voiced by Trey Parker and based on the Judeo-Christian Satan. He presides over Hell and is constantly at war with God, but far from being merciless and innately evil as Satan is often portrayed in other media, he is depicted in South Park as a soft-hearted, misunderstood anti-hero capable of compassion and genuine emotional attachment.
Many of Satan&#39;s appearances on South Park (as well as his role in the film South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp;amp; Uncut) focus on his romantic attachments, all of which so far have been homosexual. In the beginning of the story, Satan is romantically involved with Saddam Hussein. As the plot of South Park progresses, Satan exiles Saddam after Saddam becomes too domineering. Satan has since had two other partners, Chris and Kevin (see &quot;Romantic Attachments&quot;, below). Satan also has a rarely seen son named Damien, who, while never specifically labeled as the Antichrist, is rather obviously based on the character from The Omen. Satan makes a cameo on the end of the current opening.
According to the audio commentary for the episode &quot;Damien&quot;, South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone came up&lt;/p&gt;

There is no universally accepted definition of the word &quot;continent&quot;; the lay definition is &quot;One of the main continuous bodies of land on the earth&#39;s surface.&quot; (Oxford English Dictionary). By that definition, the continent of Australia includes only the Australian mainland, and not nearby islands such as Tasmania or New Guinea. From the perspective of geology or physical geography, however, a &quot;continent&quot; may be understood to include the continental shelf (the submerged adjacent area) and the islands on the shelf, which are taken to be structurally part of the continent. By that definition Tasmania, New Guinea and other nearby islands such as the Aru Islands and Raja Ampat Islands are part of the Australian continent since they are part of the same geological landmass. These islands are separated by seas overlying the continental shelf &amp;#8212; the Arafura Sea and Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea, the Timor Sea between Australia and Timor, and Bass Strait between mainland Australia and Tasmania.

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Shrek is a fictional character from the children&#39;s book Shrek! and the Shrek films. He is the main protagonist of the book and the films. The name &quot;Shrek&quot; is derived from the German and Yiddish word &quot;Schreck&quot;/&quot;Shreck&quot;, literally meaning &quot;fear, terror.&quot; He is one of the most recognizable characters of the 21st century and probably the most famous ogre ever created.
Shrek is a large, green, physically intimidating ogre, with an accent described by Myers as &quot;a Scottish guy living in Scarborough for forty years&quot;. Although his background is something of a mystery, it is assumed that despite these traits, Shrek has always been an ogre of the non-hostile kind as he loves peace and solitude and lives in a swamp (with a &quot;Beware the Ogre!&quot; sign near his home to discourage attacking villagers) and is befriended by Donkey, an excitable, hyperactive donkey. It is notable that when Shrek is first seen he is successfully scaring off villagers by roaring at them, but it later becomes obvious that they were only attacking him because he is an Ogre, not because he had done anything particularly wrong. In the first Shrek movie, during a conversation with Donkey, he laments that people &quot;judge me&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;George Huang is a Taiwanese-American film-maker.
Although none of his own films have yet to achieve major box-office success, the director has gained a small-but-loyal cult following. In addition to working on his own films, he also frequently contributes work to other independent film-makers, especially Robert Rodr&amp;#237;guez.
The son of Taiwanese immigrants, George Huang grew up with an avid love of motion pictures. After high school, he attempted to move from his love of film into something tangible by enrolling in a producing program at the University of Southern California. After graduating, he began working from the bottom-up as an aspiring executive assistant at Columbia Pictures.
In 1992, Columbia acquired the distribution rights to the film El Mariachi by Robert Rodr&amp;#237;guez. As the film was being prepared for release, Rodriguez struck up a friendship with the young studio assistant with whom he shared a love of film. As Rodriguez, a native and resident of Austin, Texas, had no L.A. residence, he stayed at Huang&#39;s apartment.
Rodriguez -known for his money-saving/high-quality filmmaking techniques- was amazed by Huang&#39;s blas&amp;#233; attitude toward the way his superiors spent millions and&lt;/p&gt;

        <IIMBTBOX:article rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Commander Data (pronounced /&amp;#712;de&amp;#618;t&amp;#601;/ DAY-t&amp;#601;), played by Brent Spiner, is a character in Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) television series and in the four subsequent The Next Generation films.
Designed and built by Doctor Noonien Soong, Data is a sentient android who serves as the second officer and chief operations officer aboard the starships USS Enterprise-D and USS Enterprise-E. His positronic brain allows him impressive computational capabilities. He has ongoing difficulties, however, understanding various aspects of human behavior and is unable to feel emotions or understand certain human idiosyncrasies. He is given an emotion chip in Star Trek: Generations.
Data is in many ways a successor to the original Star Trek&#39;s Spock (Leonard Nimoy), in that the character offers an &quot;outsider&#39;s&quot; perspective on humanity.
Gene Roddenberry told Brent Spiner that over the course of the series, Data was to become &quot;more and more like a human until the end of the show, when he would be very close, but still not quite there. That was the idea and that&amp;#8217;s the way that the writers took it.&quot; Spiner felt that Data exhibited the Chaplinesque characteristics of a sad, tragic clown. To&lt;/p&gt;

Located in the Central Valley, San Jos&amp;#233; is the seat of national government, the focal point of political and economic activity, and the major transportation hub of this Central American nation.
Founded in 1738 by order of Cabildo de Le&amp;#243;n, San Jos&amp;#233; is one of the youngest capital cities in Latin America by year of conception, though it was not named capital until 1823. Today it is a modern city with bustling commerce, brisk expressions of art and architecture, and spurred by the country&#39;s improved tourism industry, it is a significant destination and stopover for foreign visitors.
The population of San Jos&amp;#233; Canton is 346,799, though the metropolitan area stretches beyond the canton limits and comprises a third of the country&#39;s population. San Jos&amp;#233; exerts a strong influence on a wider range because of its proximity to minor cities (Alajuela, Heredia and Cartago) and the country&#39;s demographic assemblage in the Central Valley.
The city lies at a mean elevation of 1,161 m above sea level, and enjoys a stable climate throughout the year, with an average temperature of 25C (77F) and annual&lt;/p&gt;
