Cox also wrote a book on the history of the genre called 10,000 Ways to Die. While he once directed films for Universal Pictures, such as Repo Man and Walker, since the late 1980s, he has found himself on a self-described blacklist, and turned to producing independent films. Cox is an atheist. He was originally set to direct Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas but was replaced by Terry Gilliam due to creative differences with Hunter S. Thompson. By August 2009, Cox had announced completion of Repo Chick, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival the following month, but he remained ambivalent as to whether the film would ever be distributed to theaters.

It is largely populated by professionals working in the federal civil service, the U.S. military, or for one of the many private companies which contract to provide services to the federal government. The latter are known locally as beltway bandits, after the Capital Beltway, an interstate highway that circles Washington, D.C. One of Alexandria's largest employers is the U.S. Department of Defense. Others include the Institute for Defense Analyses and the Center for Naval Analyses.

In 1956 he became an American citizen while retaining his British citizenship.\nHitchcock directed more than fifty feature films in a career spanning six decades. Often regarded as the greatest British filmmaker, he came first in a 2007 poll of film critics in Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper, which said: \"Unquestionably the greatest filmmaker to emerge from these islands, Hitchcock did more than any director to shape modern cinema, which would be utterly different without him. His flair was for narrative, cruelly withholding crucial information (from his characters and from us) and engaging the emotions of the audience like no one else.\" MovieMaker has hailed him as the most influential filmmaker of all time.\nHitchcock was born on 13 August 1899 in Leytonstone, London, the second son and youngest of three children of William Hitchcock (1862&#8211;1914), a greengrocer and</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

The total land area of the territory is 91&#160;km (35&#160;sq&#160;mi), with a population of approximately 13,500 (2006 estimate).\nAnguilla was first settled by Amerindian tribes who migrated from South America. The earliest Amerindian artifacts found on Anguilla have been dated to around 1300 BC, and remains of settlements date from 600 AD. The date of European discovery is uncertain: some sources claim that Columbus sighted the island in 1493, while others state that the island was first discovered by the French in 1564 or 1565.

His father was Italian American and his mother was Irish American, and he was raised in a devoutly Roman Catholic family.\nDuring the 1970s, Assante was a regular on two NBC soap operas, How to Survive a Marriage as Johnny McGee and The Doctors as Dr. Mike Powers. His first film was The Lords of Flatbush (1974). A role that brought him greater attention came in 1980's Private Benjamin as a handsome Frenchman who becomes the love interest of a U.S. soldier played by Goldie Hawn.\nAssante's somewhat sinister look has made him a popular choice for tough-guy heroes, as in his starring role as private eye Mike Hammer in the film I, the Jury (1982) or as Mafia gangsters like that of Michael Moretti in Sidney Sheldon's Rage of Angels. He portrayed the notorious Bugsy Siegel in a comedy, Neil Simon's The Marrying Man (1991), another mobster in Hoffa (1992) starring Jack Nicholson, and crime kingpin John Gotti in the 1996 made-for-television biopic</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

The territory of Austria covers 83,872&#160;square kilometres (32,383&#160;sq&#160;mi), and has a temperate and alpine climate.

The majority of the population speaks German, which is also the country's official language. Other local official languages are Croatian, Hungarian and Slovene.\nThe origins of Austria date back to the time of the Roman Empire when a Celtic kingdom was conquered by the Romans in approximately 15 BC, and later became Noricum, a Roman province, in the mid 1st century AD&#8212;an area which mostly encloses today's Austria.

In the late 17th century, the area was settled by English colonists. By the middle of the 18th century, early settlers left their homes in Flushing and developed a farming community, Bay Side. During the Revolutionary War, the Bayside-Little Neck area suffered from raids by whaleboatmen from the Connecticut shores. In one of the raids, the Talman house was attacked and the miller was killed. In the 19th century Bayside was still mostly farmland. Middle 20th century urban sprawl, with the help of better roads, suburbanized it. During the 1920s, many actors and actresses, such as Rudolph Valentino, lived in Bayside.

Until the coming of the railway Beckenham was a small village in almost completely rural surroundings: once a family of entrepreneurs began the building of villas here, its population soared throughout the rest of the century. Today it is very much in London suburbia, although some of the grand houses of the early days remain.\nThe settlement is referred to as Bacheham in the Domesday Book of 1086. The name is thought to derive from Beohha's homestead (Beohhan + ham in Old English). The name of the small stream here - the River Beck - is most likely to have been named after the village.\nAlthough early written history tells little of the area, archaeological evidence at Holwood Park, where Stone Age and Bronze Age artefacts were found, reveals some evidence of early settlers. A Roman camp was sited here; and a Roman road, the London to Lewes Way passed through the district.\nWith the arrival of the Normans, the Manor of Beckenham took on added importance, and controlled much of what is modern Beckenham.

He was expelled from first grade for hitting a nun, and later expelled from high school&#8212;which he describes as \"one of the strictest schools in the nation\"&#8212;for excessive demerits. He started questioning his sexuality in high school, claiming, \"I remember I'd pray every night that I wasn't gay, and please God, please God, anything I could do&#8212;just don't make this happen.\" He came out at the age of seventeen and was thrown out of his house by his parents, who eventually came to accept his sexuality.\nDannelly wrote and directed short film \"He Bop\" in 2000 before his debut with 2004's religious satire film Saved!, which he directed and co-wrote with Michael Urban. He had begun to write the Saved! script after the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, which he claims took him \"back to [his] roots\" in a Christian high school.

It is the current seat of the Metro Vancouver government.\nIn the first 30 to 40 years after its incorporation, the growth of Burnaby was influenced by its location between expanding urban centres of Vancouver and New Westminster. It first served as a rural agricultural area supplying nearby markets.

Canada's common border with the United States to the south and northwest is the longest in the world.\nThe land occupied by Canada was inhabited for millennia by various groups of Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the late 15th century, British and French expeditions explored, and later settled, along the Atlantic coast. France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763 after the Seven Years' War. In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom. This widening autonomy was highlighted by the Statute of Westminster of 1931 and culminated in the Canada Act of 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament.\nA federation consisting of ten provinces and three territories, Canada is governed</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

It is unusual among Australian cities, being an entirely planned city. Following an international contest for the city's design, a design by the Chicago architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin was selected and construction commenced in 1913.\nThe city's design was heavily influenced by the garden city movement and incorporates significant areas of natural vegetation that have earned Canberra the title \"bush capital\".

The two Bailiwicks have no common laws, no common elections, and no common representative body (although their politicians consult regularly).

Laughton showed keen and serious interest in the pioneering possibilities of film, and later other media, such as radio, recordings, and TV, proving that quality work could be made available to audiences other than theatre-goers.

His mother was a devout Roman Catholic and he attended Stonyhurst College, a Jesuit school, in Lancashire, England. He served during World War I (in which he was gassed) first with the 2/1st Battalion of the Huntingdonshire Cyclist Regiment and later with the 7th Battalion of the Northamptonshire Regiment.\nHe started work in the family hotel business, while participating in amateur theatricals in Scarborough.

Even given this uncertainty, Conakry makes up almost a quarter of the population of Guinea.\nAccording to a legend, the name of the city comes from the fusion of the name \"Cona\", a wine and cheese producer of the Baga people, and the word \"nakiri\", which means in Sosso the other bank or side.\nConakry was originally settled on tiny Tombo Island and later spread to the neighboring Kaloum Peninsula, a 36-kilometer (22&#160;mi) long stretch of land 0.2 to 6 kilometers (660 to 20,000&#160;ft) wide.

The A822 joins onto the A823 which leads to Dunfermline.\nIn recent years Crieff has developed into a hub for tourism, trading mainly on its whisky and cattle droving history.

Both the library and chapel are open to the public: the library is run by a charitable trust, the chapel is in the care of Historic Scotland.\nFor a number of centuries the Highlanders came south to Crieff to sell their black cattle whose meat and hides were avidly sought by the growing urban populations in Lowland Scotland and the north of England.

The focus was the series of Cuyahoga River waterfalls that provided power for manufacturing.\nIn 1812 Kelsey and Wilcox built a dam on the Cuyahoga River at a place where a railroad bridge crossed it in 1876.

In Britain, he is also remembered as having played the Green Cross Code man. Prowse is a native of Bristol, where he attended Bristol Grammar School.\nArguably, Prowse is best known for playing the physical form of Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy. He spoke the dialogue during the filming of the movie, and didn't actually know Vader was Luke's father until he saw the movie in the cinema. Though he was never going to be used as the voice of Darth Vader, he was originally told that he would be seen and heard at the end of Return of the Jedi when Vader's mask was removed. This did not end up happening as actor Sebastian Shaw was brought in instead. However, Lucas claims he wanted a 'darker voice' (Lucas has stated that Darth Vader had to have a deep, reverberating voice) that Prowse could not provide and never intended to use Prowse's voice.

Through close contacts with the Arabian peninsula for more than 1,000 years, the Somali and Afar ethnic groups in this region became among the first on the African continent to adopt Islam.\nFrench interest developed in the nineteenth century when the area was ruled by the sultan of Raheita, Tadjoura and Gobaad. The French bought the anchorage of Obock in 1862 and expanded it eventually to a colony called French Somaliland with essentially the current boundaries.

As its borders are ill-defined and it straddles the boundary between Cork City and County Cork, it is difficult to ascertain the exact population. The CSO gives a figure of 18,192 for the parts of Douglas that lie within Cork County. No figure is provided for the parts within Cork City, although the combined population of the Tramore A, Tramore B and Tramore C electoral divisions, which lie in Douglas, is 5,001.\nThe name derives from the Irish words Dubh Ghlas, meaning Dark Stream, which still flows through the village. The stream flows into Cork Harbour.\nDouglas was first mentioned in documents in 1251. By the mid-seventeenth century, it had a population of 308 people (of whom 33 were English) and consisted of a number of large farms. The area began to develop as an urban settlement in the early eighteenth century with the opening of Donnybrook Mills in 1726. The mills produced sail-cloth and supplied sails to the British Royal Navy amongst other clients.

Scholars agree that the name of the town derives from Early Celtic 'Duboglassio' meaning 'black river' . Douglas is twice referred to in the Monastic 'Chronicle of the Kings of Man and the Isles'; first in 1192, when the monks of St Mary's Abbey at Rushen, were transferred there for a four-year stay, then again in 1313, when Robert (Bruce), King of Scotland, spent the night at the 'monastery of Duglas' on his way to seize Castle Rushen.

Over the centuries, the name has changed, and has been known as 'Illing', 1130; 'Gilling', 1243; and 'Ylling', 1254, until 'Ealing' became the standard spelling in the 19th century.\nArchaeological evidence shows that parts of Ealing have been occupied for at least 7,000 years Iron Age pots have been discovered in the vicinity on Horsenden Hill. A settlement is recorded here in the 12th century amid a great forest that carpeted the area to the west of London. The earliest surviving English census is that for Ealing in 1599.

Following the economic, scientific, political, cultural and military might of the United Kingdom from the 18th century, and of the United States since the mid 20th century, it has become the lingua franca in many parts of the world, and the leading language in international business and science. It is used widely as a second language and as an official language in the European Union and many Commonwealth countries, as well as in many world organisations.\nHistorically, English originated from several dialects, now collectively termed Old English, which were brought to the eastern coast of the island of Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers beginning in the 5th century. English was further influenced by the Old Norse language of Viking invaders.\nAfter the time of the Norman conquest, Old English developed into Middle English, borrowing heavily from the Norman-French vocabulary and spelling conventions. The etymology of the word \"English\" is a derivation from the 12th century Old English englisc from Engle, \"[the] Angles\".\nModern English developed with the Great Vowel</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

Essex County Council is the principal local authority for much of the county, sharing functions with twelve district councils. The county town is Chelmsford. The southern Essex boroughs of Thurrock and Southend-on-Sea are governed separately by unitary authorities. It was established in antiquity and formed the eastern portion of the Kingdom of Essex. Sections of the county closer to London are part of the metropolitan green belt, which prohibits development. It is the location of the regionally significant Lakeside Shopping Centre and London Stansted Airport; and the new towns of Basildon and Harlow.\nThe name Essex originates in the Anglo-Saxon period of the Early Middle Ages and has its root in the Old English &#274;astseaxe (i.e. the \"East Saxons\"), the eastern kingdom of the Saxons.\nIn pre-Roman Britain the territories of Suffolk and Essex were home to the Trinovantes tribe, which had grown wealthy through intensive trade with the Roman</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

It covers a land area of nearly 270,000&#160;km&#178; and has an estimated population of 1,500,000. Its capital and largest city is Libreville.\nSince its independence from France on August 17, 1960, Gabon has been ruled by three presidents. In the early 1990s, Gabon introduced a multi-party system and a new democratic constitution that allowed for a more transparent electoral process and reformed many governmental institutions. The small population density together with abundant natural resources and foreign private investment have helped make Gabon one of the most prosperous countries in the region, with the highest HDI in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nThe earliest inhabitants of the area were Pygmy peoples. They were largely replaced and absorbed by Bantu tribes as they migrated.\nIn the 15th century, the first Europeans arrived.

It is the administrative capital of the South-East District as well as the sub-district of Gaborone. Locals often refer to the city as Gabs.\nGaborone is situated at 24&#176;39&#8242;29&#8243;S 25&#176;54&#8242;44&#8243;E&#65279; / &#65279;24.65806&#176;S 25.91222&#176;E&#65279; / -24.65806; 25.91222 between Kgale and Oodi Hills, on the Notwane River in the southeastern corner of Botswana, and 15&#160;kilometres (9.3&#160;mi) from the South African border. The city is served by the Sir Seretse Khama International Airport.\nEvidence shows that there have been inhabitants along the Notwane River for centuries. In more recent history, Chief Kgosi Gaborone left the Magaliesberg to settle in the area around 1880, and called the settlement Moshaweng. The city was then called Gaberones by the early European settlers. Gaberones, derived from Gaborone's Village, was named after Chief Gaborone of the BaTlokwa, whose home village, now called Tlokweng, was across the river from the Government Camp, the name of the colonial government headquarters.</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

Moreover, the German Democratic Republic was disestablished after the Communist government, of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), lost the general election on March 18, 1990, and thus its parliamentary majority in the Volkskammer (People&#8217;s Chamber); subsequently, on August 23, 1990, the Volkskammer re-established the five pre-war states &#8212; Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

Later the English failed their first settlement attempts, but the French fought and conquered Grenada from the Caribs circa 1650. The French conquest resulted in the genocide of 17th century Caribs from present-day Grenada. Warfare also existed between the Caribs of present day Dominica and St. Vincent and the Grenadines with the French invaders.\nThe French took control of Camahogne and named the new French colony La Grenade.

The whalers used every part of the animals - the blubber, meat, bones and viscera were cooked to extract the oil and the bones and meat were turned into fertilizer and fodder. Elephant seals were also hunted for their blubber. Around 300 men worked at the station during its heyday, operating during the southern summer from October to March.

Five sub-regions were carved out of the landmass by colonial powers in the late 17th and early 18th century: Spanish Guiana (now eastern Venezuela), Portuguese Guiana (now northern Brazil), British Guiana (Guyana), Dutch Guiana (Suriname), and the present French overseas department of French Guiana.

He also appeared in 1938 in plays performed in White Plains, New York, with Joan Tompkins. He made his Hollywood debut in 1935, and his career gained momentum after his Academy Award-nominated performance as Tom Joad in The Grapes of Wrath, a 1940 adaptation of John Steinbeck's novel about an Oklahoma family who moved west during the Dust Bowl. Throughout six decades in Hollywood, Fonda cultivated a strong, appealing screen image in such classics as The Ox-Bow Incident, Mister Roberts and 12 Angry Men. Later, Fonda moved toward both more challenging, darker epics as Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West (portraying a villain who kills, among others, a child) and lighter roles in family comedies like Yours, Mine and Ours with Lucille Ball.\nFonda was the patriarch of a family of famous actors, including daughter Jane Fonda, son Peter Fonda, granddaughter Bridget Fonda, and grandson Troy Garity; his family and close friends called him \"Hank\".

When Harry became famous and would perform near Gillespie, Miss Burke was always sent tickets to attend his performances.\nAfter his father's death in 1930, he and his mother moved to California, where he graduated from Fallbrook High School at the age of 17 and took various odd jobs until finally settling at Douglas Aircraft Company, where he became a traveling representative.\nAt the age of 20, he was overheard singing by his landlady, Mom Rider, and was encouraged to take vocal lessons.

In 2004 he stated, \"It sort of fascinated me, and it also scared me. All those lights, all that make-up. I said to myself, 'I don't know what this is, but I want it.'\" However, fearing his father's disapproval, McDiarmid attended the University of St Andrews, where he received an M.A. in psychology.

During the British colonial era, Ipoh was Malaysia's second city for administration purposes. There are several notable buildings from the British Colonial era such as the railway station and the town hall. 70% of Ipoh's population is of Chinese origin.\nThe name Ipoh is derived from a local tree, pohon epu or now more commonly known as pokok ipoh. The sap of this plant is poisonous and was used by Orang Asli (indigenous people) to coat the tips of the darts of their blowpipes.\nThe Cantonese name for Ipoh derives the word Yee Poh meaning found treasure. This is because the Hoi San which are Cantonese were the first to move to the area for mining. They then build a small town for trading of food and hardware for the miner. They were happy with the new found tin mining town and name it \"yee poh\" (found treasure).\nIpoh is sometimes called \"Paloh\" (Chinese: &#22761;&#32645;) among local Chinese,</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

During half a century of film and television appearances he was nominated for three Academy Awards, all as Best Actor in a Supporting Role, winning in 1991 for his role in City Slickers.\nPalance, one of five children, was born Volodymyr Palahniuk in the Lattimer Mines section of Hazle Township, Pennsylvania, the son of Anna (n&#233;e Gramiak) and Ivan Palahniuk, who was an anthracite coal miner. Palance's parents were Ukrainian immigrants, his father a native of Ivane Zolote in Southwestern Ukraine and his mother from the Lviv region. He worked in coal mines during his youth before becoming a boxer.\nIn the late 1930s, Palance started a professional boxing career. Fighting under the name Jack Brazzo, Palance reportedly compiled a record of 15 consecutive victories with 12 knockouts before fighting the future heavyweight contender Joe Baksi in a \"Pier-6\" brawl.

However, after years on the force, he seemingly ended up being corrupted and worn down from the job. He specifically said how the Jack Rafferty we see in the movie is at rock bottom. Miller has confirmed there will be a graphic novel coming soon showing the rise and fall of Rafferty.\nAt the beginning of The Big Fat Kill, a drunken Rafferty is paying a visit to his old girlfriend Shellie. She wants nothing to do with him, but when he threatens to break down the door to her apartment, she lets him in out of fear, along with his pack of equally drunk friends. He wants her to call some stripper and waitress friends of hers and hit the town with him and his 'troops'.

Japanese is a mora-timed language.\nThe Japanese language is written with a combination of three scripts: Chinese characters called kanji (&#28450;&#23383;), and two syllabic scripts made up of modified Chinese characters, hiragana (&#12402;&#12425;&#12364;&#12394; or &#24179;&#20206;&#21517;) and katakana (&#12459;&#12479;&#12459;&#12490; or &#29255;&#20206;&#21517;).

A memorable later performance was in George Stevens' Shane (1953), her last screen appearance.\nArthur was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress in 1944 for her performance in The More the Merrier (1943).\nArthur was born Gladys Georgianna Greene in Plattsburgh, New York to Johanna Augusta Nelson and Hubert Sidney Greene.

Renamed Kings town upon Hull by King Edward I in 1299, the town and city of Hull has served as market town, military supply port, trading hub, fishing and whaling centre, and industrial metropolis.\nHull was an early theatre of battle in the English Civil Wars. Through its celebrated 18th century Member of Parliament, William Wilberforce, the city was the backdrop to events leading to the abolition of the slave trade in Britain.\nThe city is unique in the United Kingdom in having had a municipally owned telephone system from 1902, sporting cream, not red, telephone boxes.

He is the father of Hollywood actor and producer Michael Douglas. He was #17 on the American Film Institute's list of the greatest male American screen legends of all time.\nDouglas was born in Amsterdam, New York, to Bryna (n&#233;e Sanglel) and Herschel \"Harry\" Danielovitch, a businessman. Douglas's parents were Russian Jewish immigrants from Gomel, now in independent Belarus. His father's brother, who emigrated earlier, used the surname Demsky, which Douglas's family adopted in the United States. Douglas grew up as Izzy Demsky, although he never legally changed his name.\nComing from a poor family, as a boy, Douglas sold snacks to mill workers to earn enough to buy milk and bread. Later, he delivered newspapers and claims to have worked at more than forty jobs before becoming an actor. He found living in a family of six sisters to be stifling, \"I was dying to get out.

He was a student of Professor Kenneth Thorpe Rowe.

Still, he labored at it for five years (even picking up a Clio Award along the way), first in Detroit and later in Los Angeles where he tried to interest Hollywood in his screenplays.\nKasdan's introduction into the film business came in the mid-1970s when he sold his script for The Bodyguard to Warner Bros. as a vehicle for Diana Ross and Steve McQueen. The script became stuck in \"development hell\" and became one of several scripts successively called \"the best un-made film in Hollywood\"; it was eventually produced as a 1992 film starring Whitney Houston and Kevin</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

He is voiced by John Lithgow.\nLord Farquaad is the comically short-in-stature, ruthless ruler of the huge castle of Duloc. Several times in the film it is commented that, in Duloc's towering height, Farquaad may be compensating for something.\nIn his pursuit of perfection, Farquaad attempts to rid his kingdom of fairy tale creatures, offering a bounty for their capture and then exiling imprisoned creatures to Shrek's swamp. However, because Farquaad is not of royal stock, he cannot become a king until he marries a princess. He decides that Princess Fiona will be the perfect wife and queen, but she first must be rescued from her tower guarded by a fire-breathing dragon.\nUnwilling or unable (likely both) to perform the feat himself, Farquaad decides to hold a tournament to discover the knight that will rescue Princess Fiona when Donkey and Shrek arrive. Shrek and Donkey defeat the knights and Farquaad decides to send Shrek instead on the quest. Lord Farquaad agrees to move the fairy tale creatures out of Shrek's swamp if Shrek rescues Fiona.

The population was 5,080 at the 2000 census. There is some debate as to how Luling got its name. Some say it was named for a Chinese railroad worker, others for a judge named Luling, or that it was the maiden name of a railroad builder's wife. It is part of the Greater Austin area.\nLuling was founded in 1874 as a railroad town and became a rowdy center for the cattle drivers on the Chisholm Trail. Contempt of the law by the cowboys helped Luling become known as the \"toughest town in Texas.\" After the great cattle drives ended in the late 1880s, Luling quieted down to a town of about 500, where cotton ruled the local economy.\nThe single most important event in Luling's history was the discovery of oil by Edgar B. Davis. Davis had mortgaged everything he owned to finance drilling for oil around Luling. On August 9, 1922, The Rafael Rios No. 1 well came in at 2,161&#160;feet (659&#160;m) and produced 150&#160;barrels per day (24&#160;m/d). To repay his loans, Davis contracted 2&#160;million barrels (320,000&#160;m) at $.50 a barrel to Atlantic Oil and another 2 million to Magnolia Oil, plus another 2&#160;million barrels (320,000&#160;m)</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

Jackson the role of Mace Windu, Jackson signed on, but with certain stipulations on the portrayal of his character. Aware that the climax of the prequel trilogy would eventually call for Mace Windu's death, one of the conditions was that his character die in a spectacular fashion, rather than ingloriously be killed off. \nAlso, according to an interview on The Late Show with David Letterman on May 13, 2005, Windu's purple lightsaber was a personal request from Jackson to Lucas as a quid pro quo for appearing in the films, as well as a way of making the character unique and easily distinguishable.</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

Malagasy mythology portrays a group of African pygmy like people called the Vazimba as the original inhabitants of Madagascar, however most archaeologists estimate that the human settlement of Madagascar happened between 200 and 500 A.D., when seafarers from southeast Asia (probably from Borneo or the southern Celebes) arrived in outrigger sailing canoes.

FOX network executives objected, and asked that Mal be \"lightened up\".

After spending much of her childhood in foster homes, Monroe began a career as a model, which led to a film contract in 1946. Her early film appearances were minor, but her performances in The Asphalt Jungle and All About Eve (both 1950) were critically acclaimed. In a few years, Monroe reached stardom and was cast as the leading lady in such films as Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, How to Marry a Millionaire, Some Like It Hot, and The Seven Year Itch.\nThe typecasting of Monroe's \"dumb blonde\" persona limited her career prospects, so she broadened her range. She studied at the Actors Studio and formed Marilyn Monroe Productions. Her dramatic performance in Bus Stop was hailed by critics, and she won a Golden Globe Award for Some Like it Hot.\nThe final years of Monroe's life were marked by illness, personal problems, and a reputation for being unreliable and difficult to work with.

In 1986 independence was attained under a Compact of Free Association with the United States.\nAlthough the Marshall Islands were settled by Micronesians in the 2nd millennium BC, little is known of their early history. People traveled by canoe between islands using traditional stick charts.\nSpanish explorer Alonso de Salazar was the first European to see the islands in 1526, but they remained virtually unvisited by Europeans until the arrival of British Captain John Charles Marshall in 1788. The islands were named after him in the British maps. However, they were claimed under the Spanish sovereignty as part of the Spanish Oceania.

Mary Jane's relatively unknown early life was eventually explored in Amazing Spider-Man' #259.\nEarly issues of Amazing Spider-Man featured a running joke about Peter dodging his Aunt May's attempts to set him up with \"that nice Watson girl next door\", whom Peter had not yet met and assumed would not be his type, since his aunt liked her.

Despite the average elevation of 43&#160;m (141 ft), Montevideo has extensive beaches and seaport areas at the waterfront.\n18 de Julio is the city's main avenue and extends from the Plaza Independencia, which is the junction between the Ciudad Vieja (the historical quarter) and the rest of the city, to the boundary between the neighborhoods of Cord&#243;n and Parque Batlle.\nIn spite of its excellent location, the city of Montevideo was established in 1726, mainly as a base to defend the eastern province of Virreinato del R&#237;o de la Plata from Portuguese incursions. A few years after its foundation, Montevideo became the main city of the region north of the R&#237;o de la Plata and east of the Uruguay River, competing with Buenos Aires for dominance in maritime</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

First portrayed by James Doohan in the original Star Trek series, Scotty also appears in the animated Star Trek series, seven Star Trek movies, the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \"Relics\", and in numerous books, comics, and video games. Simon Pegg assumed the character for the 2009 film Star Trek.\nDoohan was cast as the Enterprise engineer for the second Star Trek pilot, \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\" (1966) on the recommendation of that episode's director, James Goldstone, who had worked with him before. The character almost didn't make it to the show after series creator Gene Roddenberry sent Doohan a letter informing him, \"We don't think we need an engineer in the series\"; only the intervention of Doohan's agent meant that the character could remain. He tried a variety of accents for the part, and decided to use a Scottish accent on the basis that he thought Scottish people make the best engineers. Doohan himself chose Scotty's first name of Montgomery in honor of his maternal grandfather, James Montgomery.\nPaul McGillion auditioned for the Scotty role for the 2009 Star Trek</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

The economy is concentrated around subsistence and some export agriculture clustered in the more fertile south, and the export of raw materials&#8212;especially uranium ore.

In downtown O'Fallon, a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad railroad depot was built, which helped put O'Fallon on the map. City lots were platted and sold at a public auction on May 18, 1854. A post office was established the following year and the city began attracting German settlers looking for fertile farming land. On January 27, 1874, O'Fallon was incorporated as a village.

In its industrial heyday early in the twentieth century, it was an important manufacturing center and it was the site of great iron and steel mills such as the Phoenix Iron Works, boiler works, silk mill, underwear and hosiery factories, a match factory, and the famous (and now highly collectible) Etruscan majolica pottery. Like so many American towns and cities, Phoenixville owes its growth to its waterways. It is not only situated on the broad Schuylkill River, an historic thoroughfare to Native Americans and early settlers alike, but it is bisected by the fast-flowing French Creek, which was quickly harnessed for water power.\nMuch of this history was recognized by the creation of the Phoenixville Historic District, the largest National Register of Historic Places site in Chester County.\nPhoenixville is home to the Colonial Theatre, opened in 1903.

Wise's working period spanned the 1930s to the 1990s.\nOften contrasted with contemporary \"auteur\" directors such as Stanley Kubrick who tended to bring a distinctive directorial \"look\" to a particular genre, Wise is famously viewed to have allowed his (sometimes studio assigned) story dictate style. Later critics such as Martin Scorsese would go on to expand that characterization, insisting that despite Wise's notorious workaday concentration on stylistic perfection within the confines of genre and budget, his choice of subject matter and approach still functioned to identify Wise as an artist and not merely an artisan.

Written examples of Old East Slavonic are attested from the 10th century onwards. The language is one of the six official languages of the United Nations.\nRussian distinguishes between consonant phonemes with palatal secondary articulation and those without, the so-called soft and hard sounds. This distinction is found between pairs of almost all consonants and is one of the most distinguishing features of the language. Another important aspect is the reduction of unstressed vowels, which is somewhat similar to that of English.

The entire island group, inclusive of American Samoa, was called Navigators Islands by European explorers before the 20th century because of the Samoans' seafaring skills.\nThe Samoans originated from Austronesian predecessors during the terminal eastward Lapita expansion period from Southeast Asia and Melanesia approximately 1500 BCE. The Samoan origins are currently being reassessed due to new scientific evidence and carbon dating findings from 2003 and onwards.\nIntimate sociocultural and genetic ties were maintained between the eastern Lapita colonies and the archaeological record supports oral tradition and native genealogies that indicate inter-island voyaging and intermarriage</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

It is in the same metropolitan area as the state capital, Albany; Schenectady is about fifteen miles (24&#160;km) northwest of Albany.\nThe area that is now Schenectady was originally the land of the Mohawk nation of the Iroquois Confederacy. When Dutch settlers arrived in the Hudson Valley in the middle of the 17th century, the Mohawk called the settlement at Fort Orange \"Schau-naugh-ta-da\", meaning \"over the pine plains.\" Eventually, this word entered the lexicon of the Dutch settlers, but the meaning was reversed, and the name referred to the bend in the Mohawk River where the city lies today.\nSchenectady was first settled in 1661 when the area was part of the Dutch colony of New Netherland.

That story is commonly described one of the greatest failures of modern journalism overall.\nThe film is widely considered a hilarious tale, making fun not only of the events and characters who were involved in the hoax, and who are only thinly disguised in the movie, but also of the discomfort Germany has with its difficult past. It is especially fun to viewers familiar with the country.\nThe film is co-written and directed by Helmut Dietl and, among his many respected comedies, frequently considered his best.

She learns to type, starts to date an acquaintance from high school named Peter, and begins to work as a secretary for an eccentric attorney, E.

After he confronts her about her self-injury addiction and commands that she never hurt herself again, the two embark on a BDSM relationship.

Semi-Tough also includes a parody of Werner Erhard's Erhard Seminars Training (est), depicted in the film as an organization called \"B.E.A.T.\" The film is based on the novel Semi-Tough, by Dan Jenkins, and was adapted for the screen by writer Walter Bernstein and director Michael Ritchie. Ritchie and Bernstein added a new storyline which included a satire of the self-help movement and new religions.\nSemi-Tough follows the story of pro-football friends Billy Clyde Puckett, and Marvin 'Shake' Tiller, who also have a third roommate, Barbara Jane Bookman. The two men vie for her affection throughout the film, but Shake becomes self-confident after completing a self awareness course called \"B.E.A.T.\" Bert Convy plays the role of Friedrich Bismark, the leader of B.E.A.T.

The movie is presented as a marathon of the seventh series of an American reality television show called The Contenders, where six people, picked at random from a national lottery, are each given a gun and forced to hunt and kill each other for the cameras. The film is a dark satire of the reality television genre. It stars Brooke Smith as Dawn, the reigning champion from the sixth series. It shares similarities with cult Japanese film, Battle Royale, 1986 Schwarzenegger vehicle The Running Man, and several other films.\nFive new contestants are selected in a seemingly random lottery and, along with the winner of the previous series, comprise the six Contenders. Each series of The Contenders is played in the limits of a chosen city or town. Contenders are given a gun, though they may acquire other weapons, and the last one left alive is the winner. Contestants are forced to play the game, regardless of whether they desire to. A contender who wins three tours of the game is freed from it.\nThe film purposely leaves many key details unexplained, as the viewer is supposed to be watching only what the creators actually</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

It was directed by Stanley Donen, with music by Saul Chaplin and Gene de Paul, and lyrics by Johnny Mercer. The script (by Albert Hackett, Frances Goodrich, and Dorothy Kingsley) is based on the short story The Sobbin' Women, by Stephen Vincent Ben&#233;t, which was based in turn on the Ancient Roman legend of The Rape of the Sabine Women. The film was a 1954 Oscar nominee for Best Picture.\nThe film is particularly known for the unusual choreography by Michael Kidd, which makes dance numbers out of such mundane frontier pursuits as chopping wood and (most famously) raising a barn.\nThe film's story is about a backwoodsman named Adam Pontipee and his new bride Milly, who marries him after knowing him for only a few hours. On returning with him to his cabin in the mountains, Milly is surprised to learn that Adam is one of seven lumberjack brothers living in the same cabin. The brothers have been named alphabetically from the Old Testament: Adam, Benjamin, Caleb, Daniel, Ephraim, Frank (short for Frankincense, the Old Testament having no names beginning with F), and Gideon.

It follows the story of a village of farmers that hire seven masterless samurai (ronin) to combat bandits who will return after the harvest to steal their crops.\nSeven Samurai is described as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, and is one of a select few Japanese films to become widely known in the West for an extended period of time. It is the subject of both popular and critical acclaim; it was voted onto Sight &amp; Sound's list of the ten greatest films of all time in 1982 and 1992, and remains on the directors' top ten films in the 2002 poll.\nA gang of marauding bandits approaches a mountain village. The bandit chief recognizes they have ransacked this village before, and decides it is best that they spare it until the harvest in several months.

It also contains a hidden political-satire layer specific to the time and place of its original screening.\nThe two protagonists, Max and Albert, played by Jerzy Stuhr and Olgierd &#321;ukaszewicz, respectively, submit themselves in 1991 to the first human hibernation experiment. Instead of being awakened a few years later as planned, they wake up in the year 2044, in a post-nuclear world. By then, humans have retreated to underground living facilities, and, as a result of subjection to a specific kind of radiation, all males have died out. Women reproduce through parthenogenesis.\nThe cold-shoulder treatment Max and Albert receive from the women, their character differences and specific realities of future life serve as background of many humorous encounters. The plot thickens when it turns out that the females have no interest in the rebirth of men, and that for the good of society, the two males are to be 'naturalised', i.e. undergo a sex-change. While trying to break away, Max and Albert find out the impact of their masculinity on women.

In addition, many of the characters, lines, and plot devices are references to Shakespeare's plays.\nShakespeare in Love won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actress (for Gwyneth Paltrow) and Best Supporting Actress (for Judi Dench).

It was directed by Peter Farrelly and Bobby Farrelly, and filmed in and around Charlotte, North Carolina as well as Sterling and Princeton, Massachusetts at Wachusett Mountain.\nHal Larson (Jack Black) is a superficial man whose fixation on physical beauty (despite being obese himself) gets in the way of seeing women for their inner beauty. Hal and his equally shallow friend Mauricio Wilson (Jason Alexander) spend most of their nights being obnoxious at nightclubs and being shot down. By a twist of fate, Hal becomes stuck in an elevator with famous American life coach Tony Robbins, who hypnotizes him into seeing people as their inner beauty instead of their external selves. Hal meets and is smitten by his boss's daughter, Rosemary Shanahan (Gwyneth Paltrow). Rosemary is actually obese, but appears to him as slender and beautiful due to her kind and generous nature. Used to being overlooked by men due to her appearance, Rosemary initially interprets Hal's interest in her as mocking and insulting, but later realizes his feelings for her are genuine, and the two begin to date.\nMauricio becomes worried</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

The film stars Alan Ladd, Jean Arthur and Van Heflin, and features Brandon De Wilde, Elisha Cook Jr., Jack Palance and Ben Johnson. The cinematography was by Loyal Griggs, with a music score by Victor Young.\nA mysterious stranger who calls himself Shane (Alan Ladd) drifts into an isolated western valley. It soon becomes apparent that he is a gunslinger, and he finds himself drawn into a conflict between simple homesteader Joe Starrett (Van Heflin) and powerful cattle baron Rufus Ryker (Emile Meyer), who want to force Starrett and every other homesteader in the valley off the land. Shane accepts a job as a farmhand, but finds Starrett's young son Joey (Brandon DeWilde) drawn to him for his strength and skill with a gun. Shane himself is uncomfortably drawn to Starrett's wholesomely charming wife, Marian (Jean Arthur).\nAs tensions mount between the factions, Ryker hires Jack Wilson (Jack Palance), a skilled gunslinger.

She tells him her brother, Chon Wang (Jackie Chan), is doing well as a sheriff in Carson City, Nevada, United States, but her father replies that her brother is dead to him. At that moment, Lord Nelson Rathbone (Aidan Gillen), leads a band of Boxers into the city, who attack the Keeper. Lin defends her father, but is knocked unconscious. Rathbone kills him with a snake-handled dagger, and leaves with the seal. As he lies dying, he gives Chon Lin a puzzle box and a letter to Chon Wang.\nBack in the Wild West, Chon Wang is doing well as sheriff, having captured an impressive array of fugitives.

A former Shaolin monk reunites his five brothers, years after their master's death, to apply their superhuman martial arts skills to play soccer and bring Shaolin kung fu to the masses.\nIn 2008 a sequel, produced by, but not starring Stephen Chow, was released entitled Shaolin Girl. Very few of the cast from the original film made an appearance.\nSing (Stephen Chow) is a master of Shaolinquan kung fu, whose goal in life is to promote the spiritual and practical benefits of the art to modern society. He experiments with various methods to inform the modern world about shaolin kung fu, some of which include comedic song and dance routines, but all bear no positive results. He then meets Fung (Ng Man Tat), a legendary soccer star in his days, until his teammate Hung, now a rich businessman, paid him to miss a goal. After missing the game-winning penalty kick, Fung's &#8220;Golden leg&#8221; is broken by an angry baseball bat-wielding mob (hired by Hung), forcing him to retire from active play.

In the story, a young fish named Oscar (voiced by Will Smith) falsely claims to have killed the son of a shark mob boss to win favour with the mob boss' enemies and advance his own community standing. The film additionally features the voices of Jack Black as Lenny, Ren&#233;e Zellweger as Angie, Angelina Jolie as Lola, Martin Scorsese as Sykes, and Robert De Niro as Don Lino. Its original title was Sharkslayer, but the producers thought that this might provoke a degree of misunderstanding among the target audience of the film, children and families. Shark Tale is also one of the first three feature-length films to be made into a Game Boy Advance Video. It was released into theaters on October 1, 2004. Although the film was a critical flop (especially when compared to the critically acclaimed Finding Nemo, a film with a similar theme), it was nominated for an Academy Award and a commercial success, grossing $367,275,019. The name is itself a parody of A Bronx Tale.\nThe story begins with an underachieving fish named Oscar (Will Smith), who is fantasizing about being rich and famous while making his way to work by following</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

To the east and northeast, the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System offers barge access to the Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes region.\nShawnee has a sister city program with Nikaho in Akita, Japan. This is most likely due to the presence of a TDK plant in Shawnee. Every year junior high school students from Shawnee visit Nikaho in July, and Japanese junior high school students visit Shawnee in September.\nShawnee is located at 35&#176;20&#8242;33&#8243;N 96&#176;56&#8242;2&#8243;W&#65279; / &#65279;35.3425&#176;N 96.93389&#176;W&#65279; / 35.3425; -96.93389 (35.342474, -96.933775).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 44.7&#160;square miles (115.7&#160;km&#178;).About 42.3&#160;square miles (109.5&#160;km&#178;) of it is land and 2.4&#160;square miles (6.2&#160;km&#178;) of it (5.37%) is water.\nShawnee is the home of St. Gregory's University,</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

Its name derives from the River Sheaf, which runs through the city. Historically a part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, the city has grown from its largely industrial roots to encompass a wider economic base. The population of the City of Sheffield is 534,500 (2008&#160;est.), but the wider Sheffield Urban Area, which extends beyond the city proper, had a population of 640,720 as of the 2001 census. Sheffield is one of the eight largest regional English cities that make up the English Core Cities Group.\nDuring the 19th century, Sheffield gained an international reputation for steel production. Many innovations were developed locally, including crucible and stainless steel, fuelling an almost tenfold increase in the population during the Industrial Revolution. Sheffield received its municipal charter in 1893, when it officially became the City of Sheffield. International competition in iron and steel caused a decline in traditional local industries during the 1970s and 1980s, coinciding with the collapse of coal mining in the area.\nThe 21st century has seen extensive redevelopment</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

Upon its release, the film was praised for its message, as well as its technical production. In 1966, the film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound. Due in part to her performance in Shenandoah, Rosemary Forsyth was nominated for a Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer - Female.\nIn view of the decidedly anti-war tone of this film, and that of the character of Charlie Anderson, it is worth noting that James Stewart was a brigadier general in the US Air Force Reserve at the time of its filming, and had been a decorated bomber pilot and squadron commander in World War II; he would fly as an observer and additional pilot on one B-52 mission in Vietnam as part of his reserve duty a year after the film's release.\nStewart's own son Ronald (adopted from his wife's first marriage) would be killed in action in Vietnam as a US Marine Corps officer a few years later.

Jake must also deal with the fantasy woman of his dreams. The film is largely a parody of traditional 1980s suburban life and the cultural expectations that come along with it. To a large extent what Jake experiences could be described as a form of culture shock, with his best man Davis (Alec Baldwin) as a reminder of his former culture as a single man, and feeling alienated when he overhears his neighbors converse about mundane suburban topics. He feels he has left the culture of single men, and has entered the culture of a married man, and doesn't appear to have a sense of belonging to either.\nThis film is a look at the lives of Jake and Kristy Briggs, from their wedding day until the birth of their first child. Beginning on their wedding day, it follows both their lives, but more so Jake's, with his voice over commentaries and several imaginary scenes, based on actual or feared future</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

The film portrays the life of Sid Vicious, bassist of the seminal punk rock band the Sex Pistols. It stars Gary Oldman as Vicious and Chloe Webb as his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen.\nThe film opens with several police officers dragging a distressed Sid Vicious (Gary Oldman) out of the Chelsea Hotel. On the way out reporters relentlessly pursue Sid, asking him why he did it, Sid telling them off in reply. Vicious is soon driven to a police station and upon arrival is asked to describe what has happened to him up to this point and if he was the one who called the police. Sid recounts the details of what happened in his life.\nA few years earlier, Sid and John Lydon (Andrew Schofield) are shown smashing the windows of a car until a small black puppy is shown to be inside. Lydon jokingly provokes Sid to \"slay the beast,\" but Sid instead pets the dog's head and they leave the ruined car behind with the dog looking on in confusion.\nLater back at a bar, Lydon and Sid meet up with Paul Cook (Perry Benson) and Steve Jones (Tony London) at a bar where the group proceeds to drink and throw darts.</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

In entertainment silent films the acting and dialogue is commuted through muted gestures, pantomime and title cards. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. After The Jazz Singer in 1927, \"talkies\" became more and more commonplace and within a decade silent films essentially disappeared.\nThe first film was created by Louis Le Prince in 1888. It was a two second film of people walking around in Oakwood Grange garden, titled Roundhay Garden Scene. The art of motion pictures grew into full maturity in the \"silent era\" before silent films were replaced by \"talking pictures\" in the late 20s. Many film scholars and buffs argue that the aesthetic quality of cinema decreased for several years until directors, actors, and production staff adapted to the new \"talkies\".\nThe visual quality of silent movies &#8212; especially those produced during the 1920s</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

He is best known for his starring roles in Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Run Fatboy Run, the comedy series Spaced and his portrayal of Montgomery \"Scotty\" Scott in the revamped Star Trek. Much of his major work has been in collaboration with some combination of Nick Frost, Jessica Hynes, Dylan Moran and Edgar Wright.\nPegg was born in Brockworth, Gloucestershire, England, the son of Gillian Rosemary (n&#233;e Smith), a civil servant, and John Henry Beckingham, a jazz musician and keyboard salesman. His parents divorced when he was seven and he took on the surname \"Pegg\" after his mother re-married. He attended many schools, including Castle Hill Primary School, Brockworth Comprehensive Secondary School, and later Stratford-upon-Avon College to study English literature and performance studies. Pegg studied drama at the University of Bristol and wrote his undergraduate thesis on \"A Marxist overview of popular 1970s cinema and hegemonic discourses\". At Bristol he appeared in a Drama Society production of Howard Barker's Victory alongside Sarah Kane and David Greig.\nIn</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

It is a film noir based on Miller's graphic novel series of the same name.\nThe film is primarily based on three of Miller's works: The Hard Goodbye, about a man who embarks on a brutal rampage in search of his one-time sweetheart's killer; The Big Fat Kill, which focuses on a street war between a group of prostitutes and a group of mercenaries; and That Yellow Bastard, which follows an aging police officer who protects a young woman from a grotesquely disfigured serial killer. The movie stars Bruce Willis, Alexis Bledel, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Michael Clarke Duncan, Rosario Dawson, Benicio del Toro, Michael Madsen, Nick Stahl, Powers Boothe, Josh Hartnett, Jaime King, Brittany Murphy, Elijah Wood and Rutger Hauer, among others.\nSin City opened to wide critical and commercial success, gathering particular recognition for the film's unique coloring procession, which rendered most of the film in black and white but retained or added coloring for select objects. The film was screened at the 2005 Cannes Film</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

It is now frequently described as one of the best musicals ever made, topping the AFI's 100 Years of Musicals list, and ranking fifth in its updated list of the greatest American films in 2007.\nDon Lockwood (Gene Kelly) is a popular silent film star with humble roots as a singer, dancer, and stunt man. Don barely tolerates his vapid, shallow leading lady, Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), though their studio, Monumental Pictures, links them romantically to increase their popularity. Lina herself is convinced they are in love, despite Don's protestations otherwise.\nOne day, to escape from overenthusiastic fans, Don jumps into a passing car driven by Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds).

The film was written and directed by John Hughes.\nAwkward high school sophomore Samantha \"Sam\" Baker (Molly Ringwald) struggles to get through the day of her sixteenth birthday, which her entire family forgets because her older sister, Ginny (Blanche Baker), is getting married the next day. She is also plagued by her ongoing infatuation with the very popular and very attractive senior, Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling). Her day at school fares no better when she finds out that her completed \"sex quiz,\" which she surreptitiously slipped to her friend, never reached her (and, unbeknownst to either of them, was picked up by Jake Ryan himself). Sam panics as the quiz contains personal information, including the fact that she is a virgin and is saving herself for Jake.\nShe has a whole new set of problems when she arrives home to find that both sets of grandparents are staying at the Baker home for the duration of the wedding visit. On top of it all, one set of grandparents brings along bizarre foreign exchange student Long Duk Dong (Gedde Watanabe). Sam's grandparents force</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

The film is about the young punk rock fan Steven \"Stevo\" Levy, a college graduate living in Salt Lake City. The character is portrayed as an exaggerated stereotype of an anarchist punk in the mid 1980s. Many events and characters in the movie are allegedly based on real life, although they may have been exaggerated.\nThe character of Stevo is based on the life of writer/director James Merendino, although the character is named after Stephen Egerton, originally known as Stephen \"Stevo\" O'Reilly, who played for the Salt Lake City punk band Massacre Guys, and eventually joined the L.A. bands Descendents and ALL. SLC Punk was chosen as the opening-night feature at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival.\nThe film outlines the daily lives of two punks in Salt Lake City in the summer of 1985. The film is shot in a documentary, \"slice-of-life\" style, with frequent voiceovers by Stevo (Matthew Lillard), who narrates the film in past-tense, and his best friend \"Heroin\" Bob (Michael A.

Based on a story by Jeff Arch, it stars Tom Hanks as Sam Baldwin and Meg Ryan as Annie Reed.\nThe film was inspired by An Affair to Remember and used both its theme song and clips from the film in critical scenes. The climactic meeting at the top of the Empire State Building is a reference to a reunion between Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr in An Affair to Remember that fails to happen because the Kerr character is struck by a car while en route. At one point, some of the characters discuss Affair, with Sam commenting that it sounds like a \"chick movie.\"\nSam Baldwin, a Chicago architect, has lost his wife (Carey Lowell) to cancer. He and his young son Jonah move from Chicago to Seattle to make a fresh start, but Sam is still disconsolate. On Christmas Eve, Jonah calls into a Chicago radio advice show and persuades his father to go on the air with him to talk about how much he misses his wife.

It inspired several other trucking films, including two sequels, Smokey and the Bandit II (originally known as Smokey and the Bandit Ride Again in the U.K.), and Smokey and the Bandit Part 3. There were also a series of 1994 television movies (Bandit Goes Country, Bandit Bandit, Beauty and the Bandit and Bandit's Silver Angel) from original director/writer Hal Needham loosely based on the earlier version, with actor Brian Bloom now playing Bandit. The three original movies introduced two generations of the Pontiac Trans Am (while the TV-movie version drives the Dodge Stealth). The film was the second highest grossing film of 1977, beaten only by Star Wars.\nAs the movie begins, rich Texas wheeler and dealer Big Enos Burdette (Pat McCormick) and his son, Little Enos (Paul Williams), are trying to find a truck driver willing to haul Coors beer to Georgia for their refreshment.

Set in the London criminal underworld, the film contains two intertwined plots &#8212; one dealing with the search for a stolen diamond, the other with a small-time boxing promoter named Turkish (Jason Statham) who finds himself under the thumb of a sadistic gangster known as Brick Top (Alan Ford).\nSnatch is characterized by an assortment of colourful characters, including the \"pikey\" Irish Traveller Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt), Russian-Uzbek ex-KGB agent and arms-dealer Boris \"the Blade\" Yurinov (Rade Sherbedgia), professional thief and gambling addict Frankie \"Four-Fingers\" (Benicio del Toro) and bounty hunter Bullet-Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones). It is also distinguished by a kinetic direction and editing style, a circular plot featuring numerous ironic twists of chance and causality, and a fast pace.\nThe film shares similar themes, ideas and motifs as Ritchie's first film, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.

Snoop is best known as an MC in the West Coast hip hop scene, and for being one of Dr. Dre's most notable prot&#233;g&#233;s. Snoop Dogg was a Crip gang member while in high school. Shortly after graduation, he was arrested for cocaine possession and sentenced to three years in prison. His music career began in 1992 after his release when he was discovered by Dr. Dre. He collaborated on several tracks on Dre's solo debut, The Chronic and on the titular theme song to the film Deep Cover.\nSnoop's debut album, Doggystyle, was released in 1993 under Death Row Records. Doggystyle went quadruple platinum and spawned several hit singles, including \"What's My Name\" and \"Gin &amp; Juice.\" In 1996, Snoop Dogg was cleared of charges over his bodyguard's 1993 murder of Philip Woldemariam. His second album, 1996's Tha Doggfather, was his last release for Death Row before he signed with No Limit Records, where he recorded three albums from 1998 to 2001.

Myers plays Charlie McKenzie, a man afraid of commitment until he meets Harriet (Travis), who works at a butcher shop and may be a serial killer. In addition to playing the main character, Myers also plays Charlie's father, Stuart.\nThis was Myers' first film after achieving success in the Wayne's World franchise and was not well received by most mainstream critics or at the box office, grossing a total of USD $11 million in North America, well below its $20 million budget.\nCharlie McKenzie (Myers) is a beat poet with Scottish roots and a fear of making a big commitment such as marriage. He even proceeds to create outlandish reasons to break up his relationships (\"She smelled like soup\", \"she was in the mafia\" or \"she stole my cat\" are some of the memorable reasons). This all changes when Charlie meets Harriet (Travis), a butcher whose first date with Charlie has him assisting Harriet on a busy day at her store. Eventually, Charlie continues to date and ultimately becomes engaged to Harriet.

Solyaris) (1972), directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, is a meditative psychodrama occurring mostly aboard a space station orbiting the planet Solaris. The scientific mission has stalled, because the scientist crew have fallen to emotional crises. Psychologist Kris Kelvin travels to the Solaris space station, to learn and evaluate the situation &#8212; yet soon hallucinates like the others.\nThe Polish science fiction novel by Stanis&#322;aw Lem is about the ultimate inadequacy of communication between human and non-human species. Director Tarkovsky&#8217;s Russian film adaptation of the Solaris (1961) novel is a &#8220;drama of grief and partial recovery&#8221; concentrated upon the thoughts and the consciences of the cosmonaut scientists studying an extra-terrestrial (alien) life. The psychologically complex and slow narrative of Solaris has been contrasted to kinetic Western science fiction films, which rely upon fast narrative pace and special effects to communicate character psychology and an imagined future. The ideas which Tarkovsky tried to express in this film are further developed in Stalker.\nThe critically successful Solaris features Natalya Bondarchuk (Hari), Donatas Banionis</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

It is the largest town in, and administrative centre of, the larger Metropolitan Borough of Solihull which itself has a population of 200,400.\nHistorically part of Warwickshire, Solihull is one of the most prosperous towns in the English Midlands. Residents of Solihull and those born in the town are referred to as Silhillians. The motto of Solihull is Urbs in Rure (Town in the Country).\nSolihull derived its name from a 'dirty or muddy' or soily hill which was given by passers-by at the time. The parish church was built on a hill of stiff red marl, which turned to sticky mud in wet weather.\nThe town has existed since medieval times when it was founded as a market town and it later became an important coaching and mail coach stop. Solihull probably came into being about a thousand years ago, as a clearing in the forest to which people would come to trade.

Self-government was achieved in 1976 and independence two years later.

It was one of the many successful teen dramas written by John Hughes in the 1980s, although this one was directed by Howard Deutch. During filming, Deutch met Thompson and two years later the two got married. The film is considered a cult classic of the Brat Pack era due to its strong themes that were seen in previous Hughes productions.\nThe movie is set against the strict social hierarchy of an American public high school. The tomboyish Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson) has always considered working-class Keith Nelson (Eric Stoltz) her best friend. But when Keith asks out the most popular girl in school, Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson), Watts realizes she feels something much deeper for him. Hardy Jenns (Craig Sheffer), Amanda's jealous former boyfriend from the rich section of town, still wants her and plans to get back at Keith. Eventually all this is sorted out, with Amanda realizing she needs time alone, and Keith cluing into Watts's feelings and realizing he loves her, too.\nThe film was generally well-received by critics.

Logan had already written the story &#8211; but without the gangsters &#8211; for a German film, Fanfaren der Liebe (directed by Kurt Hoffmann, 1951), so Wilder's film is considered by some as a remake.\nDuring 1981, after the worldwide success of the French comedy La Cage aux Folles, United Artists re-released Some Like It Hot to theatres. In 2000, the American Film Institute listed Some Like It Hot as the greatest American comedy film of all time.\nTwo struggling musicians, Joe and Jerry (Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon), witness what looks like the Saint Valentine's Day massacre of 1929. When the Chicago gangsters, directed by 'Spats' Columbo (George Raft), see them, the duo flee for their lives.

In the UK the film was originally released under the title Fraternally Yours.\nThe film begins at a meeting of the Sons of the Desert, a fraternal lodge (styled to resemble the Shriners) of which both Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are members. The organisation will be holding its annual convention in Chicago in a week and all members have to take an oath to attend. Stan is reluctant to take the oath, but Oliver goads him into it. Later, on the way home, Stan explains to Oliver his reluctance to take the oath; he is worried that his wife will not let him go to the convention. Oliver tries to reassure Stan that because he took a sacred oath, his wife has no choice but to let him go. When they get home and Stan accidentally brings up the subject of the convention, however, it turns out Oliver's wife will not let him go as they had already arranged a mountain trip together (which Oliver had forgotten about).\nUnwilling to go back on the oath that he swore, Oliver</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

Starring Charlton Heston, the film overlays the police procedural and science fiction genres as it depicts the investigation into the brutal murder of a wealthy businessman in a dystopian future suffering from pollution, overpopulation, depleted resources, poverty, dying oceans and a hot climate due to the greenhouse effect. Much of the population survives on processed food rations, including the eponymous \"soylent green\".\nThe film, which is loosely based upon the 1966 science fiction novel Make Room! Make Room!, by Harry Harrison, won the Nebula Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film in 1973.\nIn the year 2022, the population has grown to forty million people in New York City alone. Most housing is dilapidated and overcrowded, and the homeless fill the streets and line the fire escapes and stairways of buildings. Food as we know it today is a rare and expensive commodity. Most of the world's population survives on processed rations produced by the massive Soylent Corporation, including Soylent Red and Soylent Yellow, which are advertised as</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

It was released on June 24, 1987, and earned only modest returns, but has gone on to become a seminal cult classic on video. Its plot and characters contain numerous parodies of elements primarily from the original Star Wars trilogy, as well as Star Trek and other popular science fiction films.\nPlanet Spaceball, led by President Skroob (Mel Brooks), has wasted all of its air and, desperate to find more, plans the extraction of all the air from planet Druidia. They plan to kidnap the Druish Princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga), who is about to marry the narcoleptic Prince Valium (Jim J. Bullock). Resenting this marriage, Vespa runs off from the altar with her Droid of Honor, Dot Matrix (Joan Rivers/Lorene Yarnell), and escapes into space, where she is attacked by the Spaceballs under the command of Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis).\nVespa's father, King Roland (Dick Van Patten), hires Captain Lone Starr (Bill Pullman) and his mawg (half-man, half dog) sidekick Barf (John Candy), who are desperate for money to pay back their debts to the Mafioso Pizza the Hutt (Dom DeLuise), to rescue his daughter.</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

During the 5th century, Hispania was invaded by Germanic Vandals, Suevi and Visigoths, and other eastern peoples (Alans), resulting in numerous dialects of Vulgar Latin. After the Moorish Conquest in the 8th century, Arabic became an influence in the evolution of Iberian languages including Castilian.\nModern Spanish developed with the Readjustment of the Consonants (Reajuste de las sibilantes) that began in 15th century.

The film stars Kirk Douglas as rebellious slave Spartacus and Laurence Olivier as his foe, the Roman general and politician Marcus Licinius Crassus. The film also stars Peter Ustinov (who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as slave trader Lentulus Batiatus), John Gavin (as Julius Caesar), Jean Simmons, Charles Laughton, John Ireland, Herbert Lom, Woody Strode, Tony Curtis, John Dall and Charles McGraw. The titles were designed by Saul Bass.\nThe film begins with slaves working in the Roman province of Libya. Spartacus (Kirk Douglas), a burly Thracian, comes to the aid of an old man who has fallen down. A Roman soldier whips Spartacus and tells him to get back to work, only to be attacked and bitten on the ankle. For this, Spartacus is tied up and sentenced to death by starvation. Lentulus Batiatus (Peter Ustinov), a lanista (an impresario of gladiatorial games), arrives looking for recruits for his gladiatorial establishment.

Differing from both the film and novel, The Waltons watered down many of the adult themes, including alcoholism and infidelity. Spencer's Mountain features the majestic scenery of Wyoming's Grand Teton mountain range, as photographed by cinematographer Charles Lawton in CinemaScope.\nThe film centers on the trials and tribulations of the Spencers, a Depression-era family living in the Grand Teton Mountains of Wyoming. As the patriarch of a large and growing family, Clay Spencer (Henry Fonda) is fiercely independent, yet dedicated to his family. While he resists the influence of religion, he struggles to remain faithful to his wife Olivia (Maureen O'Hara), to allow his son (James MacArthur) to attend college, and to build a new home for his family.\nThe movie is set in Wyoming.

The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko. He first appeared in Amazing Fantasy #15 (Aug. 1962). Lee and Ditko conceived of the character as an orphan being raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, and as a teenager, having to deal with the normal struggles of youth in addition to those of a costumed crime fighter. Spider-Man's creators gave him super strength and agility, the ability to cling to most surfaces, shoot spider-webs using devices of his own invention which he called \"web-shooters,\" and react to danger quickly with his \"spider-sense\", enabling him to combat his foes.\nWhen Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, a teenage high school student to whose \"self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness\" young readers could relate. Unlike previous teen heroes such as James Buchanan \"Bucky\" Barnes and Robin, Spider-Man did not benefit from being the proteg&#233; of any adult mentors like Captain America and Batman,</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The original music score was composed by Lee Holdridge. It was the very first film released by Touchstone Pictures.\nAs a boy, Allen Bauer, who does not know how to swim, leaps into the water off Cape Cod after something only he can see. He is rescued from drowning by a young mermaid, and an instant connection forms between the two. When his parents retrieve him, no one sees the mermaid, who weeps at the loss of her new friend before departing. Allen comes to believe the encounter was a near-death hallucination, but his bond with the mermaid proves so strong that his subsequent relationships with women invariably fail as he subconsciously seeks the connection he felt with the mermaid.\nYears later, now co-owner with his womanizing brother Freddie of a wholesale fruit and vegetable business in New York City, Allen, depressed after his latest breakup, returns to Cape Cod, where he briefly encounters eccentric scientist Dr. Walter Kornbluth, and again falls into the sea.

In the 2009 film Star Trek, Nimoy reprised his role alongside Zachary Quinto, who played a younger, alternate-timeline version of the character, with Jacob Kogan playing Spock as a child. \nSpock (second name unpronounceable by humans and thus never revealed, according to dialogue between Spock and character Leila Kalomi in the original series episode \"This Side of Paradise\") is the son of Vulcan ambassador Sarek (originally played by Mark Lenard) and human Amanda Grayson (originally played by Jane Wyatt). The relationship between Spock and Sarek is often turbulent, although rooted in an underlying respect and carefully restrained love for each other. Their falling out began when Spock declined an offer to study at the prestigious Vulcan Science Academy and instead joined Starfleet against his father's wishes.\nSpock served on the USS Enterprise for eleven years</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

It is the first film in the series to star the cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation. It was shot in Overton, Nevada; Paramount Studios; and Lone Pine, California. While the film did reasonably well at the box office, it received mixed reviews from critics.\nThe story begins with Captain James T. Kirk, recently retired, reluctantly attending the maiden voyage of the USS Enterprise-B in 2293, which is running on a skeleton crew and has several major subsystems still under construction. During the voyage, the Enterprise is pressed into a rescue mission to save two ships from a strange energy ribbon. The Enterprise is able to save some of the El-Aurian refugees, including Dr. Tolian Soran and Guinan before both ships are destroyed, but then becomes trapped in the ribbon itself. Kirk travels to the Engineering decks to alter the behavior of the deflector shields, allowing the Enterprise to escape. The Energy Ribbon makes contact with the engineering hull and causes major damage and while the crew recovers, they find the section that Kirk</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

Intent on returning home to Earth to face trial for their crimes, the former crew of the USS Enterprise travels to Earth's past in order to save their present from a probe attempting to communicate with long-dead humpback whales.\nAfter directing The Search for Spock, cast member Leonard Nimoy was asked to direct the next feature, and given greater freedom to the film's content.

It is the tenth feature film in the Star Trek franchise, and the fourth and final film to star the cast from the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation. It follows the mission of the crew of the USS Enterprise-E as they are forced to deal with a threat to the United Federation of Planets from a Reman named Shinzon who has taken control of the Romulan Star Empire in a coup.\nNemesis acted as a swan song for The Next Generation cast, as could be seen from the film's tagline of \"A generation's final journey begins\". The film was the least commercially successful in the franchise, and was poorly received by the majority of critics.\nThe film opens on the Romulan Imperial Senate being presented by the military with plans to invade the Federation. The Praetor dismisses the proposal and rebukes the military. Afterward, a senator takes leave of the senate, leaving a small object behind. The object opens, releasing a green mist into the air that covers the room. Moments</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

The success of the series in syndication convinced the studio to begin work on a feature film in 1975. A series of writers attempted to craft a suitably epic script, but the attempts did not satisfy Paramount, so the studio scrapped the project in 1977. Paramount instead planned on returning the franchise to its roots with a new television series, Star Trek: Phase II. The box office success of Close Encounters of the Third Kind convinced Paramount that science fiction films other than Star Wars could do well at the box office, so the studio canceled production of Phase&#160;II and resumed</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

It was the fourth film to be released in the Star Wars saga, the first of a three-film prequel story to the original film trilogy. It was also Lucas' first film as a director in 22 years, and only his fourth overall. The film follows Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who flee the planet Naboo with Queen Amidala in the hope of finding a peaceful end to a trade dispute. Along the way, the ship must stop for repairs on the planet Tatooine, where the Jedi encounter Anakin Skywalker, a young slave boy who is unusually strong with the Force. Meanwhile, they must contend with the mysterious return of the Sith.\nLucas began production when he felt special effects had advanced to the level of what he had envisioned for the film. Shooting took place during 1997 at various locations including Leavesden Film Studios and the Tunisian desert. Special effects made extensive use of computer-generated imagery, with some characters and scenarios being completely digital.\nThe Phantom Menace was released on May 19, 1999, almost sixteen years after the previous film in the</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

Ground-breaking in its use of special effects, unconventional editing, and sci-fi/fantasy storytelling, the original Star Wars is one of the most successful and influential films of all time.\nSet a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, the film follows a group of freedom fighters known as the Rebel Alliance who are plotting to destroy the Death Star space station, a powerful device created by the evil Galactic Empire. This conflict disrupts the isolated life of farmboy Luke Skywalker when he inadvertently acquires the droids carrying the stolen Death Star plans. When the Empire begins a cruel and destructive search for the droids, Skywalker decides to accompany Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi on a daring mission to rescue the owner of the droids, rebel leader Princess Leia Organa, and save the galaxy.\nProduced with a budget of $11 million and released on May 25, 1977, the film went</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

The film is shot in black-and-white, particularly reminiscent of Federico Fellini's 8&#189; (1963), which it parodies. It was nominated for a Writers Guild of America award for \"Best Comedy written directly for screen\".\nIt is the story of a famous filmmaker Sandy Bates (Allen), who is plagued by fans who prefer his \"earlier, funnier movies\" to his more recent artistic efforts, while he tries to reconcile his conflicting attraction to two very different women: the earnest, intellectual Daisy (Jessica Harper), and the more maternal Isobel (Marie-Christine Barrault). Meanwhile, he is also haunted by memories of his ex-girlfriend, the mercurial Dorrie (Charlotte Rampling).\nThe conflict between the maternal, nurturing woman and the earnest, usually younger one, is a recurring theme in Allen's films. Like many of Allen's films, Stardust Memories incorporates several jazz recordings including those by such notables as Louis Armstrong, Django Reinhardt, and Chick Webb.

The film functions as a sort of prequel to the TV series, as it portrays when Starsky was first partnered with Hutchinson. The film also switches the personalities of the title characters.

There are four Frat Pack members in this film, although not all are in major roles.\nThe movie takes place in the fictional city of Bay City, California in 1975. The story centers around two cops who work for the Bay City Police Department. The city has a distinctly southern California atmosphere to it and Bay City is very similar to Los Angeles.

J. Soles, and John Candy. Stripes also featured several noted actors in their first significant movie roles, including John Larroquette, Sean Young, John Diehl and Judge Reinhold. It was one of Canadian comedian John Candy's early breakthrough film appearances. Dave Thomas, Bill Paxton and Timothy Busfield are also in one scene apiece. The film was among Oates' last films, as he died of a heart attack the year after it was released.\nJohn Winger is a slacker in his late 20s (played by Bill Murray, age 31) who drives a cab in Louisville. He experiences the worst day of his life as, in the span of just a few hours, he quits his job, his car is repossessed, he drops his pizza on the street, and his girlfriend dumps him. Realizing that his life is a failure, he decides he needs a new direction. At that moment, a recruiting ad for the U.S. Army plays on the television, and he decides that is just what he needs to get in shape (and meet girls).

The film was directed by Andrew Bergman. Based on the book Strip Tease by Carl Hiaasen, it is about a stripper who becomes involved in both a child custody dispute and corrupt politics.\nStriptease was generally reviled by critics. The film wound up winning several Golden Raspberry Awards (Razzies), which are given to the worst in cinema. Among these awards given to Striptease was the Razzie Award for Worst Picture of 1996.\nThe film revolves around Erin Grant (Moore), a former FBI secretary, who loses custody of her young daughter Angela to her ex-husband Darrell. In order to afford an appeal, Erin becomes a stripper at the Eager Beaver, a Miami strip club. A Congressman named David Dilbeck (Reynolds) visits the club and immediately begins to adore Grant. Aware of Dilbeck's embarrassing indulgences, another Eager Beaver patron approaches Erin with a plan to manipulate the Congressman to settle the custody dispute in Erin's favour. However, Dilbeck has powerful business connections who want to ensure he remains in office. Consequently, those who can embarrass him in an election are murdered.</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

Today, in common with many other villages, there is little of this local industry left. It is home to a golf course, cement works, a nursery/garden centre and most of the village area is still covered with worked arable land although it takes many fewer people to run an arable farm than it did in the 1800s.\nThe village was once host to a railway station and hotel on Water Lane but both are now private dwellings. The Stour Valley Railway once connected Sturmer to Colchester, Cambridge, Sudbury and many other important towns but was eventually closed as part of the Beeching Axe which shut many branch lines.\nOne of the previous incumbents of Sturmer was the father of actress Charlotte Rampling, who was born in Sturmer.

Its lower altitude gives the city a warm temperate climate year-round.\nOn November 30, 1538, Sucre was founded under the name Ciudad de la Plata de la Nueva Toledo by Pedro Anzures, Marqu&#233;s de Campo Redondo. In 1538, the Spanish King Philip II established the Audiencia de Charcas in La Plata with authority over an area which covers what is now Paraguay, southeastern Peru, Northern Chile and Argentina, and much of Bolivia. The Audiencia de Charcas was a subdivision of the Viceroyalty of Peru. In 1601, the Recoleta Monastery was founded by the Franciscans and in 1609, an archbishopric was founded in the city.

It is situated at the mouth of the River Wear.\nThe name \"Sunderland\" is reputed to come from Soender-land (soender/sunder being the Anglo-Saxon infinitive, meaning \"to part\", (cf. \"(a)sunder\"), likely to be reference to the valley carved by the River Wear on whose South bank the original settlement of Sunderland was founded.\nHistorically a part of County Durham, there were three original settlements on the site of modern-day Sunderland. On the north side of the river, Monkwearmouth was settled in 674 when Benedict Biscop founded the Wearmouth-Jarrow monastery. Opposite the monastery on the south bank, Bishopwearmouth was founded in 930. A small fishing village called Sunderland, located toward the mouth of the river (modern day East End) was granted a charter in 1179.\nOver the centuries, Sunderland grew as a port, trading coal and salt. Ships began to be built on the river in the 14th century. By the 19th century, the port of Sunderland had grown to absorb Bishopwearmouth and Monkwearmouth.\nA person who is</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

In 2057, with the Earth in peril from the dying Sun, the crew is sent to reignite the Sun with a massive stellar bomb, a nuclear device with the equivalent mass of Manhattan Island. The crew is made up of an ensemble cast consisting of Cillian Murphy, Chris Evans, Rose Byrne, Michelle Yeoh, Cliff Curtis, Troy Garity, Hiroyuki Sanada, Benedict Wong, Chipo Chung, and Mark Strong.\nThe script was based on a scientific back-story that took the characters on a psychological journey. The director cast a group of international actors for the film, and had the actors live together and learn about topics related to their roles, as a form of method acting. To have the actors realistically react to visual effects that would be implemented in post-production, the filmmakers constructed live sets to serve as cues.\nPrevious science fiction films that Boyle cited as influences included Kubrick's 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, the 1972 Tarkovsky's Solaris, and the 1979 science-fiction horror film Alien.

The film's main characters have the same given names as Rogen and Goldberg. The film was one of a string of hits by Judd Apatow.\nIt is two weeks before the end of high school. Evan (Michael Cera) and Seth (Jonah Hill) are long-time friends in their senior year of high school, about to leave for different colleges. Their mutual friend, Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), has plans to acquire a fake ID, so Seth agrees to buy alcohol for a party that his crush, Jules (Emma Stone), is hosting. Evan also offers to buy Goldslick vodka for his long-time crush Becca (Martha MacIsaac).\nWhile purchasing the alcohol Fogell is assaulted by a hooded robber, and the police soon arrive. The two officers, Michaels (Seth Rogen) and Slater (Bill Hader), appear to be fooled by Fogell's fake ID (which has the single name \"McLovin\" as his identity) and offer Fogell a lift to the party.

The film documents this lifestyle's drastic effects on Spurlock's physical and psychological well-being, and explores the fast food industry's corporate influence, including how it encourages poor nutrition for its own profit. Spurlock dined at McDonald's restaurants three times per day, eating every item on the chain's menu. He also always \"super-sized\" his meal&#8212;but only if it was offered. Spurlock consumed an average of 20.92 megajoules or 5,000 kcal (the equivalent of 9.26 Big Macs) per day during the experiment. As a result, the then-32-year-old Spurlock gained 24&#189; lbs.

It stars the voices of Shia LaBeouf, Jeff Bridges, Zooey Deschanel, Jon Heder among others.\nIt was Sony Pictures Animation's second theatrical feature. The American premiere occurred on June 8, 2007. It is directed by Ash Brannon (the co-director of Toy Story 2) and Chris Buck (the director of Tarzan). Pre-production for Surf's Up began in 2002.\nIt is a parody of surfing documentaries, such as The Endless Summer and Riding Giants, with parts of the plot parodying North Shore. Real-life surfers Kelly Slater and Rob Machado have vignettes as their penguin surfer counterparts. To obtain the desired hand-held documentary feel, the film's animation team motion-captured a physical camera operator's moves.\nA documentary crew follows the events of Cody Maverick (voiced by Shia LaBeouf) a small rockhopper penguin residing in Shiverpool, Antarctica (a pun on Liverpool, England). After a childhood visit from surf legend Zeke \"Big Z\" Topanga, Cody aspires to emulate the renowned legend by becoming a famous and respected surfer.\nEventually, talent scout</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

Her parents divorced by 1915 and she was adopted by her stepfather, Sigmund Sidney, a dentist.

As a student of the Theater Guild's School for Acting, Sidney appeared in several of their productions during the 1920s and earned praise from theater critics. In 1926, she was seen by a Hollywood talent scout and made her first film appearance later that year.\nDuring the Depression, Sidney appeared in a string of films, often playing the girlfriend or the sister of a gangster. She appeared opposite such heavyweight screen idols as Spencer Tracy, Henry Fonda, Joel McCrea, Fredric March, George Raft (a frequent screen partner), and Cary Grant.

In 1992, he helped form Image Comics, pulling the occult anti-hero character Spawn from his high school portfolio and updating him for the 1990s. Spawn was a popular hero in the 1990s and encouraged a trend in creator-owned comic book properties.\nIn recent years, McFarlane has illustrated comic books less often, focusing on entrepreneurial efforts, such as McFarlane Toys and Todd McFarlane Entertainment, a film and animation studio. In September, 2006, it was announced that McFarlane will be the Art Director of the newly formed 38 Studios, formerly Green Monster Games, founded by major league baseball pitcher Curt Schilling.

His elder brother is fellow film director Ridley Scott.\nBorn in North Shields, then in Northumberland, Tony Scott's first foray into filmmaking was not from behind the camera, but rather in front of it. At the age of 16, Tony appeared in Boy and Bicycle, a short film marking the directorial debut of his then 23 year-old brother Ridley. He followed in his elder brother's footsteps, studying at Grangefield School, West Hartlepool College of Art and Sunderland Art School, the last for a fine arts degree. He subsequently graduated from the Royal College of Art, fully intending to become a painter. It was only the success of his elder brother's fledging television commercial production outfit, Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), that turned his attentions towards film.\n\"Tony had wanted to do documentaries at first.

Ub's birth name can be seen on early &#8220;Alice&#8221; shorts that he signed.

The two met in 1919 while working for the Pesman Art Studio in Kansas City, and would eventually start their own commercial art business together. Disney and Iwerks then found work as illustrators for the Kansas City Slide Newspaper Company (which would later be named The Kansas City Film Ad Company).

Although peripheral to London, the town has good transport links; it was first connected to central London by rail in 1885 and has a station on the London Underground network. The economic history of Upminster is characterised by a shift from farming to garden suburb. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Upminster significantly expanded and increased in population, becoming part of Hornchurch Urban District in 1934, and has formed part of Greater London since 1965.\nThe placename Upminster is first recorded in 1062 as Upmynstre and is recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book as Upmunstra.

By 1887, the transcontinental railway was extended to the city to take advantage of its large natural seaport, which soon became a vital link in a trade route between the Orient, Eastern Canada, and London.

Europeans began to settle in the area in the late 18th century. In the 1880s France and the United Kingdom claimed parts of the country, and in 1906 they agreed on a framework for jointly managing the archipelago as the New Hebrides through a British-French Condominium. An independence movement arose in the 1970s, and the Republic of Vanuatu was created in 1980.\nThe prehistory of Vanuatu is obscure; archaeological evidence supports the commonly held theory that peoples speaking Austronesian languages first came to the islands some 4,000 years ago.

Wales has a population estimated at three million and is officially bilingual; Welsh and English have equal status, and bilingual signs are the norm throughout the land. For most people in Wales, English is their only language. The once-steady decline in Welsh speaking has reversed over recent years, however, with Welsh speakers currently estimated to be around 20% of the population.\nDuring the Iron Age and early medieval period, Wales was inhabited by the Celtic Britons. A distinct Welsh national identity emerged in the centuries after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations today. In the 13th century, the defeat of Llewelyn by Edward I completed the Anglo-Norman conquest of Wales and brought about centuries of English occupation. Wales was subsequently incorporated into England with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535&#8211;1542, creating the legal entity known today as England and Wales.

The suffix &#8220;-ey&#8221; denotes an island or area of dry land. Originally the higher ground now occupied by Wallasey was separated from the rest of Wirral by the creek known as Wallasey Pool (which later became the docks), the marshy areas of Bidston Moss and Leasowe, and sand dunes along the coast.\nBefore the 19th century the area was sparsely populated. Horse races organised for the Earls of Derby on the sands at Leasowe in the 16th and 17th centuries are regarded as forerunners of the modern Derby.\nOld maps show that the main centre and parish church (St Hilary&#8217;s) were located at what is now called Wallasey Village, and there were smaller hamlets at Liscard, Poulton and Seacombe, from where there were occasional ferries across the Mersey.

Schloss means \"castle\" in German, and Castle probably chose to translate his surname into English to avoid the discrimination often encountered by Jewish entertainers of his time. He spent most of his teenage years working on Broadway in a number of jobs ranging from set building to acting. This put him in a good stead to become a director, and he left for Hollywood at the age of 23, going on to direct his first film 6 years later. He also worked an as assistant to director Orson Welles, doing much of the second unit location work for Welles' noir classic, The Lady from Shanghai.\nCastle was famous for directing films with many gimmicks which were ambitiously promoted, despite being reasonably low budget B-movies. Five of these were scripted by adventure novelist Robb White. Recently, two of his films have been remade, House on Haunted Hill in 1999, and Thirteen Ghosts in 2001 (the latter retitled Thir13en Ghosts).\nHe also produced, and had a brief non-speaking role in, Roman Polanski's film Rosemary's Baby (1968).

He becomes comfortable on the Enterprise, repeatedly turning down offers of his own command, and he learns to cherish the company of his fellow officers. Nonetheless, Riker retains a willingness to occasionally disregard the chain of command.

The city has a rich heritage and has provided the backdrop to major political events throughout much of its two millennia of existence.\nThe city was founded by the Romans in 71&#160;AD. They called it Eboracum, a name perhaps derived from one used by the British tribes who inhabited the area. The Romans made it the capital of their Province of Britannia Inferior. At the end of Roman rule in 415&#160;AD the settlement was taken over by the Angles and the city was renamed Eoforwic. It served as the capital of the Anglian Kingdom of Northumbria. When the Vikings captured the city in 866&#160;AD they renamed it J&#243;rv&#237;k and it became the capital of a wider kingdom of the same name covering much of Northern England. After the Norman conquest, the name \"York\", which was first used in the 13th&#160;century, gradually evolved.

The question of who created the character of Venom became an issue of contention in 1993 when Michelinie wrote to the comic book industry magazine Wizard, which had referred to Michelinie in issue #17 as \"co-creator\" of Venom. In his letter, printed in issue #21 (May 1993), Michelinie wrote that he was the character's sole creator, while saying also he believed that without McFarlane the character would not</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

Kom&#225;rno was formed from part of a historical town in Hungary situated on both banks of the Danube. Following World War I, the border of the newly created Czechoslovakia cut the historical, unified town in half, creating two new towns. The smaller part, based on the former suburb of &#218;jsz&#337;ny, is in present-day Hungary as Kom&#225;rom (the historical Hungarian town had the same name). Kom&#225;rno and Kom&#225;rom are connected by the Elizabeth bridge, and the two towns used to be a border crossing between Slovakia and Hungary until border checks were lifted due to the Schengen Area rules.\nKom&#225;rno is Slovakia's principal port on the Danube. It is also the center of the Hungarian community in Slovakia, which makes up roughly 60% of the town's population. The town is the historic seat of the Serbian national minority in Slovakia.\nOne disputed record of the name of the settlement can be dated back to 1075 as Camarum.

It also is home to Treloar College, the National Specialist college for Young Disabled People. The town is twinned with Pertuis, France  and Montecchio Maggiore, Italy.\nJane Austen lived in the nearby village of Chawton.\nA Roman road ran from Chichester to Silchester and there is evidence of a Roman posting station at Neatham near Alton, probably called Vindomis, and a ford across the River Wey. Centuries later, a Saxon settlement was established in the area and a large seventh century cemetery has been discovered during building excavations. It contained a selection of grave goods which included the Alton Buckle which is on display in the Curtis Museum, and is considered to be the finest piece of Anglo Saxon craftsmanship found in Hampshire. The buckle was found in the grave of a warrior, and has a silver-gilt body, set with garnets and glass.\nThe River Wey has its source in the town, and the name Alton comes from an Anglo-Saxon word \"aewielltun\" meaning \"farmstead at the source of the river\".\nIn</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

She was the wife of King Harold (currently a widow), and mother to Princess Fiona.\nQueen Lillian makes her debut in the film Shrek 2, as Queen of Far Far Away. Although initially surprised at Fiona's transformation into an ogre, she is far more understanding of what has happened and, seeing that her daughter is deeply in love, accepts Shrek into their family. When King Harold is turned back into the Frog King at the end of the movie, she still accepts him as she did years ago.\nIn Shrek the Third, she becomes a more determined character, leading the pack of princesses through a series of tunnels in the castle, and breaking two walls with her head, whilst humming \"My Favorite Things\" (an in-joke referring to the song sung by Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music). She is able to rally the other princesses from being damsels in distress to independent fighters. It was also revealed in the movie that Fiona inherited her fighting skills from her mother (Lillian even asks \"Well where do you think you got all your skills from, your father?\"). Lillian is last seen after the movie's finale in Shrek's swamp home,</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

The character also appeared briefly in the original story Shrek!. He currently has 6 children, with his wife, Dragon.\nDonkey is seen as being very annoying and obnoxious.\nHe likes to sing and also has a sweet tooth. He enjoys such foods as waffles, parfait and \"upside-down coconut souffl&#233; with mango chutney sauce.\" In a scene about Merlin's bonfire, Donkey's sweet tooth gets the best of him, for he sees only a fudge torte on it in the enchanted smoke.\nIn the \"Meet the Cast of Shrek 2\" segment that is featured in the Special Features part on the Shrek 2 DVD, Eddie Murphy says: \"Donkey is a really positive character. He's always looking at the bright side of everything, trying to work it out. A happy-go-lucky donkey.\"\nThe first appearance of Donkey is when an old woman tries to sell him to Lord Farquaad's guards for money. Since Donkey refuses to talk, the captain doesn't believe that he can. By his own oral accounts, Donkey had suffered a life of abuse and ridicule before (literally) running into Shrek, a grouchy, reclusive ogre. When</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

In the beginning of the story, Satan is romantically involved with Saddam Hussein. As the plot of South Park progresses, Satan exiles Saddam after Saddam becomes too domineering. Satan has since had two other partners, Chris and Kevin (see \"Romantic Attachments\", below). Satan also has a rarely seen son named Damien, who, while never specifically labeled as the Antichrist, is rather obviously based on the character from The Omen. Satan makes a cameo on the end of the current opening.\nAccording to the audio commentary for the episode \"Damien\", South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone came up</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

By that definition Tasmania, New Guinea and other nearby islands such as the Aru Islands and Raja Ampat Islands are part of the Australian continent since they are part of the same geological landmass.

He is the main protagonist of the book and the films. The name \"Shrek\" is derived from the German and Yiddish word \"Schreck\"/\"Shreck\", literally meaning \"fear, terror.\" He is one of the most recognizable characters of the 21st century and probably the most famous ogre ever created.\nShrek is a large, green, physically intimidating ogre, with an accent described by Myers as \"a Scottish guy living in Scarborough for forty years\". Although his background is something of a mystery, it is assumed that despite these traits, Shrek has always been an ogre of the non-hostile kind as he loves peace and solitude and lives in a swamp (with a \"Beware the Ogre!\" sign near his home to discourage attacking villagers) and is befriended by Donkey, an excitable, hyperactive donkey. It is notable that when Shrek is first seen he is successfully scaring off villagers by roaring at them, but it later becomes obvious that they were only attacking him because he is an Ogre, not because he had done anything particularly wrong. In the first Shrek movie, during a conversation with Donkey, he laments that people \"judge me</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

In addition to working on his own films, he also frequently contributes work to other independent film-makers, especially Robert Rodr&#237;guez.\nThe son of Taiwanese immigrants, George Huang grew up with an avid love of motion pictures. After high school, he attempted to move from his love of film into something tangible by enrolling in a producing program at the University of Southern California. After graduating, he began working from the bottom-up as an aspiring executive assistant at Columbia Pictures.\nIn 1992, Columbia acquired the distribution rights to the film El Mariachi by Robert Rodr&#237;guez. As the film was being prepared for release, Rodriguez struck up a friendship with the young studio assistant with whom he shared a love of film. As Rodriguez, a native and resident of Austin, Texas, had no L.A. residence, he stayed at Huang's apartment.\nRodriguez -known for his money-saving/high-quality filmmaking techniques- was amazed by Huang's blas&#233; attitude toward the way his superiors spent millions and</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

His positronic brain allows him impressive computational capabilities. He has ongoing difficulties, however, understanding various aspects of human behavior and is unable to feel emotions or understand certain human idiosyncrasies. He is given an emotion chip in Star Trek: Generations.\nData is in many ways a successor to the original Star Trek's Spock (Leonard Nimoy), in that the character offers an \"outsider's\" perspective on humanity.\nGene Roddenberry told Brent Spiner that over the course of the series, Data was to become \"more and more like a human until the end of the show, when he would be very close, but still not quite there. That was the idea and that&#8217;s the way that the writers took it.\" Spiner felt that Data exhibited the Chaplinesque characteristics of a sad, tragic clown.
